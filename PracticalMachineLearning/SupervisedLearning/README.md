# Kaggle competition

## Sentence Pair Classification Competition - PML 2023

This project showcases my participation in the [Sentence Pair Classification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sentence-pair-classification-pml-2023) hosted on Kaggle, where I achieved a ranking of 13th out of 115 participants.

The competition focused on classifying pairs of Romanian sentences and scoring participants based on the macro F1 score on a provided test set.

Throughout the competition, I implemented various text preprocessing techniques, experimented with different classifiers, conducted hyperparameter tuning using grid search, and addressed imbalanced datasets through adasyn/smote methods. These experiences significantly enhanced my proficiency in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. All the information can be found in the attached documentation.
