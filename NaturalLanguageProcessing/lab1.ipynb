      "AT the beginning of the year 1814, the attitude of New England\n",
      "pleased no one, and perhaps annoyed most the New England people\n",
      "themselves, who were conscious of showing neither dignity, power,\n",
      "courage, nor intelligence. Nearly one half the people of the five New\n",
      "England States supported the war, but were paralyzed by the other half,\n",
      "which opposed it. Of the peace party, one half wished to stop the war,\n",
      "but was paralyzed by the other half, which threatened to desert their\n",
      "leaders at the first overt act of treason. In this dead-lock every one\n",
      "was dissatisfied, but no one seemed disposed to yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a situation could not last. In times of revolution treason might\n",
      "be necessary, but inert perversity could at no time serve a useful\n",
      "purpose. Yet the Massachusetts Federalists professed only a wish to\n",
      "remain inert. Josiah Quincy, who fretted at restraints, and whose\n",
      "instincts obliged him to act as energetically as he talked, committed\n",
      "his party to the broad assertion that “a moral and religious people”\n",
      "could not express admiration for heroism displayed in a cause they\n",
      "disapproved. They would defend Massachusetts only by waiting to be\n",
      "invaded; and if their safety depended on their possessing the outlet\n",
      "of Lake Champlain, they would refuse to seize it if in doing so\n",
      "they should be obliged to cross the Canadian line. With one accord\n",
      "Massachusetts Federalists reiterated that until their territory should\n",
      "be actually invaded, they would not take arms. After January 1, 1814,\n",
      "when news of the battle of Leipzig arrived, the dreaded invasion of New\n",
      "England became imminent; but the Federalists, officially and privately,\n",
      "insisted on their doctrine of self-defence.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “In the tumult of arms,” said Governor Strong in his speech to\n",
      "   the legislature, January 12, 1814, “the passions of men are\n",
      "   easily inflamed by artful misrepresentations; they are apt to\n",
      "   lose sight of the origin of a contest, and to forget, either\n",
      "   in the triumph of victory or the mortification of defeat, that\n",
      "   the whole weight of guilt and wretchedness occasioned by war is\n",
      "   chargeable upon that government which unreasonably begins the\n",
      "   conflict, and upon those of its subjects who, voluntarily and\n",
      "   without legal obligation, encourage and support it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Massachusetts Senate echoed the sentiment in language more\n",
      "emphatic:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   “Beyond that submission which laws enacted agreeably to the\n",
      "   Constitution make necessary, and that self-defence which the\n",
      "   obligation to repel hostile invasions justifies, a people can\n",
      "   give no encouragement to a war of such a character without\n",
      "   becoming partakers in its guilt, and rendering themselves\n",
      "   obnoxious to those just retributions of Divine vengeance by\n",
      "   which, sooner or later, the authors and abettors of such a war\n",
      "   will be assuredly overtaken.”\n",

      "   “It is only after the failure of an attempt to negotiate,\n",
      "   prosecuted with evidence of these dispositions on the part of\n",
      "   our Administration, that any voluntary support of this unhappy\n",
      "   war can be expected from our constituents.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In thus tempting blows from both sides, Massachusetts could hardly fail\n",
      "to suffer more than by choosing either alternative. Had she declared\n",
      "independence, England might have protected and rewarded her. Had she\n",
      "imitated New York in declaring for the Union, probably the Union would\n",
      "not have allowed her to suffer in the end. The attempt to resist both\n",
      "belligerents forfeited the forbearance of both. The displeasure of\n",
      "Great Britain was shown by a new proclamation, dated April 25, 1814,\n",
      "including the ports of New England in the blockade; so that the whole\n",
      "coast of the Union, from New Brunswick to Texas, was declared to be\n",
      "closed to commerce by “a naval force adequate to maintain the said\n",
      "blockade in the most rigorous and effective manner.”[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "However annoying the blockade might be, it was a trifling evil compared\n",
      "with other impending dangers from Great Britain. Invasion might be\n",
      "expected, and its object was notorious. England was known to regret the\n",
      "great concessions she had made in the definitive treaty of 1783. She\n",
      "wished especially to exclude the Americans from the fisheries, and to\n",
      "rectify the Canadian boundary by recovering a portion of Maine, then a\n",
      "part of Massachusetts. If Massachusetts by her neutral attitude should\n",
      "compel President Madison to make peace on British terms, Massachusetts\n",

      "a minority of their party; but in conspiracies, men who knew what they\n",
      "wanted commonly ended by controlling the men who did not. Pickering\n",
      "was not popular; but he had the advantage of following a definite\n",
      "plan, familiar for ten years to the party leaders, and founded on the\n",
      "historical idea of a New England Confederation.[2] For Pickering,\n",
      "disunion offered no terrors. “On the contrary,” he wrote, July 4, 1813,\n",
      "“I believe an immediate separation would be a real blessing to the\n",
      "‘good old thirteen States,’ as John Randolph once called them.”[3] His\n",
      "views on this subject were expressed with more or less fidelity and\n",
      "with much elaboration in a pamphlet published in 1813 by his literary\n",
      "representative, John Lowell.[4] His policy was as little disguised as\n",
      "his theoretical opinions; and in the early part of the year 1814, under\n",

      "did not necessarily imply a wish for disunion. The Constitution was\n",
      "violated more frequently by its friends than by its enemies, and often\n",
      "the extent of such violations measured the increasing strength of the\n",
      "Union. In such matters intent was everything; and the intent of the\n",

      "candidate, but declared their intention to vote for Samuel Dexter, a\n",
      "Federalist,--although Dexter, in a letter dated February 14, reiterated\n",
      "his old opinions hostile to the embargo, and professed to be no further\n",

      "   reasonable terms of peace? Why make publications and speeches\n",

      "   government, and hint that an attempt to divide the empire might\n",
      "   be justified?... The ferocious contest that would be the effect\n",
      "   of attempting to skulk from a participation of the burdens of\n",
      "   war would not be the greatest calamity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Under such circumstances the load of the embargo became too heavy for\n",
      "the Massachusetts Republicans to carry. They tried in every manner to\n",
      "throw it off, as persistently as President Madison tried to hold it\n",
      "on. Their candidate, Dexter, argued strongly against the restrictive\n",
      "system in his letter consenting to stand. They drew a distinction\n",
      "between the restrictive system and the war; but even in regard to the\n",
      "war they required not active support, but only abstinence from active\n",
      "resistance. The Federalists used the embargo to stimulate resistance\n",
      "to the war, and advocated a New England convention under cover of the\n",
      "unpopularity of commercial restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the pertinacity which was his most remarkable trait, Madison clung\n",
      "to the embargo all winter in face of overwhelming motives to withdraw\n",
      "it. A large majority in Congress disliked it. England having recovered\n",
      "her other markets could afford to conquer the American as she had\n",
      "conquered the European, and to wait a few months for her opportunity.\n",
      "The embargo bankrupted the Treasury, threatened to stop the operations\n",
      "of war, and was as certain as any ordinary antecedent of a consequent\n",
      "result to produce a New England convention. Yet the President\n",
      "maintained it until the news from Europe caused a panic in Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Massachusetts election took place in the first days of April,\n",
      "while Congress was engaged in repealing the embargo and the system\n",
      "of commercial restrictions. The result showed that Dexter might have\n",
      "carried the State and defeated the project of a New England convention,\n",
      "had the embargo been repealed a few weeks earlier. A very large\n",
      "vote, about one hundred and two thousand in aggregate, was cast. The\n",
      "Federalists, whose official vote in 1813 was 56,754, threw 56,374\n",
      "votes; while the Republicans, who cast 42,789 votes in 1813, numbered\n",
      "45,359 in 1814.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reduction of the Federalist majority from fourteen thousand to\n",
      "eleven thousand was not the only reason for believing that Dexter\n",
      "might have carried Massachusetts but for the embargo. At the same time\n",
      "William Plumer, supported like Dexter by the Republicans, very nearly\n",
      "carried New Hampshire, and by gaining a majority of the executive\n",
      "council, precluded the possibility that New Hampshire as a State\n",
      "could take part in a New England convention. The President’s Message\n",
      "recommending a repeal of the embargo was sent to Congress March 31, and\n",
      "the Act of Repeal was signed April 14. Two weeks later, April 28, the\n",
      "New York election took place. To this election both parties anxiously\n",
      "looked. The Administration press admitted that all was lost if New York\n",
      "joined Massachusetts,[10] and the New England Federalists knew that a\n",
      "decisive defeat in New York would leave them to act alone. The returns\n",
      "were watched with such anxiety as had seldom attended a New York\n",
      "election, although no general State officer was to be chosen.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May, 1813, Governor Tompkins carried the State by a majority of only\n",
      "3,506, and the Federalists in the House of Assembly numbered sixty,\n",
      "while the Republicans numbered fifty-two. The city of New York and\n",
      "the counties of Queens, Westchester, Dutchess, Columbia, Rensselaer,\n",
      "and Washington--the entire range of counties on the east shore of the\n",
      "Hudson--were then Federalist. The counties of Albany, Montgomery,\n",
      "Oneida, Otsego, Madison, and Ontario in the centre of the State\n",
      "were also Federalist. At the congressional election of 1812, twenty\n",
      "Federalists and six Republicans had been chosen. The May election\n",
      "of 1814 was for the State Assembly and for Congress. No opportunity\n",
      "was given for testing the general opinion of the State on a single\n",
      "issue, but no one could mistake what the general opinion was. City and\n",
      "State reversed their political character. The Republicans recovered\n",
      "possession of the Assembly with a large majority of seventy-four to\n",
      "thirty-eight, and the Congressional delegation numbered twenty-one\n",
      "Republicans and only six Federalists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result was supposed to be largely due to a dislike of the New\n",
      "England scheme and to a wish among New York Federalists that it should\n",
      "be stopped. The energy of the demonstration in New York marked the\n",
      "beginning of an epoch in national character; yet the change came too\n",
      "late to save Massachusetts from falling for the first time into the\n",
      "hands of the extreme Federalists. The towns of Massachusetts chose as\n",
      "their representatives to the General Court a majority bent on taking\n",
      "decisive action against the war. Connecticut and Rhode Island were\n",
      "controlled by the same impulse, and the discouraged Republicans could\n",

      "prevented only by a treaty of peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effect of the attitude of New England was felt throughout the\n",
      "Union, and, combined with the news from Europe, brought a general\n",
      "conviction that peace must be made. No man in the Union was more\n",
      "loyal to the war than Governor Shelby of Kentucky, but Shelby already\n",
      "admitted that peace had become necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “I may in confidence confess to you,” wrote Shelby, April 8,[11]\n",
      "   “that I lament over my country that she has in her very bosom a\n",
      "   faction as relentless as the fire that is unquenchable, capable\n",
      "   of thwarting her best interests, and whose poisonous breath is\n",
      "   extending to every corner of the Union. There is but one way\n",
      "   to cure the evil, and that is an awful and desperate one; and\n",
      "   in the choice of evils we had better take the least. Were we\n",
      "   unanimous I should feel it less humiliating to be conquered, as\n",
      "   I verily believe that the Administration will be driven to peace\n",
      "   _on any terms_ by the opposition to the war.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If Governor Shelby had reached this conclusion before he knew the\n",
      "result of the Massachusetts election, the great mass of citizens who\n",
      "had been from the first indifferent to the war felt that peace on any\n",
      "terms could no longer be postponed. Mere disunion was not the result\n",
      "chiefly to be feared. That disunion might follow a collapse of the\n",

      "   some other parts have stopped discounting any new paper. I ask a\n",

      "ranks more than half full.[17] The first three months of the year\n",
      "produced less than six thousand recruits.[18] The government could\n",
      "defend the frontier only at three or four fortified points. On the\n",
      "ocean, government vessels were scarcely to be seen. The Treasury was\n",
      "as insolvent as the banks, and must soon cease even the pretence of\n",

      "The Secretary of the Treasury, authorized by law to borrow twenty-five\n",
      "millions and needing forty, offered a loan for only ten millions\n",
      "shortly before Congress adjourned. In Boston the government brokers\n",
      "advertised that the names of subscribers should be kept secret,[19]\n",
      "while the Boston “Gazette” of April 14 declared that “any man who lends\n",
      "his money to the government at the present time will forfeit all claim\n",
      "to common honesty and common courtesy among all true friends to the\n",
      "country.” The offers, received May 2, amounted to thirteen millions,\n",
      "at rates varying from seventy-five to eighty-eight. Jacob Barker, a\n",
      "private banker of New York, offered five million dollars on his single\n",
      "account. The secretary knew that Barker’s bid was not substantial, but\n",
      "he told the President that if it had been refused “we could not have\n",
      "obtained the ten millions without allowing terms much less favorable to\n",
      "the government.”[20] The terms were bad at best. The secretary obtained\n",
      "bids more or less substantial for about nine millions at eighty-eight,\n",
      "with the condition that if he should accept lower terms for any part\n",
      "of the sixteen millions still to be offered, the same terms should be\n",
      "conceded to Barker and his associates. The operation was equivalent to\n",
      "borrowing nine millions on an understanding that the terms should be\n",
      "fixed at the close of the campaign. Of this loan Boston offered two\n",
      "millions, and was allotted about, one million dollars.\n",

      "than stop payments; but Campbell was earnest to effect his loan at\n",
      "eighty-eight, and accordingly accepted only four million dollars\n",
      "besides Barker’s offer. With these four millions, with whatever part\n",
      "of five millions could be obtained from Barker, with interest-bearing\n",
      "Treasury notes limited to ten million dollars,[21] and with the\n",
      "receipts from taxes, the Treasury was to meet demands aggregating about\n",

      "For this desperate situation of the government New England was chiefly\n",
      "responsible. In pursuing their avowed object of putting an end to\n",
      "the war the Federalists obtained a degree of success surprising even\n",
      "to themselves, and explained only by general indifference toward the\n",
      "war and the government. No one could suppose that the New England\n",
      "Federalists, after seeing their object within their grasp, would desist\n",
      "from effecting it. They had good reason to think that between Madison’s\n",
      "obstinacy and their own, the national government must cease its\n",
      "functions,--that the States must resume their sovereign powers, provide\n",
      "for their own welfare, and enter into some other political compact; but\n",

      "for bad taste, by the society to which he belonged, because he called\n",
      "by inappropriate epithets the form of society which most of his\n",
      "fellow-citizens preferred. In New England, where democracy was equally\n",

      "commonly an affair of compromise and relative truth,--a human attempt\n",
      "to modify the severity of Nature’s processes,--could not expect\n",
      "sympathy from the absolute and abstract behests of religion. Least\n",
      "of all could war, even in its most necessary form, be applauded or\n",
      "encouraged by any clergyman who followed the precepts of Christ. The\n",
      "War of 1812 was not even a necessary war. Only in a metaphysical or\n",
      "dishonest sense could any clergyman affirm that war was more necessary\n",
      "in 1812 than in any former year since the peace of 1783. Diplomacy had\n",
      "so confused its causes that no one could say for what object Americans\n",
      "had intended to fight,--still less, after the peace in Europe, for\n",
      "what object they continued their war. Assuming the conquest of Canada\n",
      "and of Indian Territory to be the motive most natural to the depraved\n",

      "thousand men, sick and well, went into winter-quarters at French Mills,\n",
      "on the Canada line, about eight miles south of the St. Lawrence.\n",
      "Wilkinson was unfit for service, and asked leave to remove to Albany,\n",
      "leaving Izard in command; but Armstrong was not yet ready to make the\n",
      "new arrangements, and Wilkinson remained with the army during the\n",
      "winter. His force seemed to stand in a good position for annoying the\n",
      "enemy and interrupting communications between Upper and Lower Canada;\n",
      "but it lay idle between November 13 and February 1, when, under orders\n",
      "from Armstrong, it was broken up.[23] Brigadier-General Brown, with two\n",
      "thousand men, was sent to Sackett’s Harbor. The rest of the army was\n",
      "ordered to fall back to Plattsburg,--a point believed most likely to\n",
      "attract the enemy’s notice in the spring.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilkinson obeyed, and found himself, in March, at Plattsburg with\n",
      "about four thousand effectives. He was at enmity with superiors and\n",
      "subordinates alike; but the chief object of his antipathy was the\n",
      "Secretary of War. From Plattsburg, March 27, he wrote a private letter\n",
      "to Major-General Dearborn,[25] whose hostility to the secretary was\n",
      "also pronounced: “I know of his [Armstrong’s] secret underworkings, and\n",
      "have therefore, to take the bull by the horns, demanded an arrest and\n",
      "a court-martial.... Good God! I am astonished at the man’s audacity,\n",
      "when he must be sensible of the power I have over him.” Pending the\n",
      "reply to his request for a court-martial, Wilkinson determined to make\n",
      "a military effort. “My advanced post is at Champlain on this side. I\n",
      "move to-day; and the day after to-morrow, if the ice, snow, and frost\n",
      "should not disappear, we shall visit the Lacolle, and take possession\n",

      "nearer than Isle aux Noix ten miles away; but it was stationed\n",
      "in a stone mill, with thick walls and a solid front. He took two\n",
      "twelve-pound field-guns to batter the mill, and crossing the boundary,\n",
      "March 30, with his four thousand men, advanced four or five miles to\n",
      "Lacolle Creek. The roads were obstructed and impassable, but his troops\n",
      "made their way in deep snow through the woods until they came within\n",
      "sight of the mill. The guns were then placed in position and opened\n",

      "mill was unharmed. He ventured neither to storm it nor flank it; and\n",
      "after losing more than two hundred men by the fire of the garrison, he\n",
      "ordered a retreat, and marched his army back to Champlain.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this last example of his military capacity Wilkinson disappeared\n",
      "from the scene of active life, where he had performed so long and\n",
      "extraordinary a part. Orders arrived, dated March 24, relieving him\n",
      "from duty under the form of granting his request for a court of\n",

      "handful when Major-General Izard arrived at Plattsburg on the first\n",
      "day of May. Izard’s experience formed a separate narrative, and made\n",

      "arriving at Sackett’s Harbor, consulted Chauncey, and allowed himself\n",
      "to be dissuaded from attacking Kingston. “By some extraordinary mental\n",

      "same conclusion,--that the main action, an attack on Kingston, being\n",
      "impracticable, the _ruse_, intended merely to mask it, might do as\n",
      "well.” Brown immediately marched with two thousand men for Niagara.\n",

      "instruction at Buffalo, and, waiting for recruits who never came,\n",
      "personally drilled the officers of all grades. Scott’s energy threw\n",

      "Jesup of the Twenty-fifth. Throwing the flanks obliquely forward,\n",

      "outflanking, Scott ordered an advance; and at the same time Riall\n",

      "lines advanced, stopping alternately to fire and move forward, while\n",
      "Towson’s guns, having blown up a British caisson, were turned on the\n",
      "British column. The converging American fire made havoc in the British\n",
      "ranks, and when the two lines came within some sixty or seventy paces\n",
      "of each other in the centre, the flanks were actually in contact. Then\n",
      "the whole British line broke and crumbled away.[56] Ripley’s brigade,\n",
      "arriving soon afterward, found no enemy on the plain. The battle had\n",

      "while Scott’s other battalions attacked in front. So vigorous was\n",

      "sides, and only officers on the spot could decide with certainty how\n",
      "the enemy could be placed under most disadvantage, and how the army\n",
      "could be saved from needless dangers. Ripley, cautious by nature,\n",
      "recommended a retreat to Fort Erie. With the assent, as he supposed, of\n",
      "Brown and Porter,[99] Ripley immediately broke up the camp at Chippawa,\n",
      "and began the march to Fort Erie, sixteen miles in the rear. Although\n",
      "complaint was made of the retreat as confused, hasty, and unnecessary,\n",
      "it was conducted with no more loss or confusion than usual in such\n",
      "movements,[100] and its military propriety was to be judged by its\n",

      "the remains of the army camped on a plain, outside the unfinished\n",

      "was inevitable in case of a reverse. Ripley favored a withdrawal\n",
      "of the army to the American side; but Brown, from his sick bed at\n",
      "Buffalo, rejected the idea of a retreat, and fortunately Drummond’s\n",
      "reinforcements arrived slowly. The worst result of the difference\n",
      "in opinion was to make Brown harsh toward Ripley, who--although\n",
      "his record was singular in showing only patient, excellent, and\n",

      "other.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Major Trimble, Lieutenant-Colonel Drummond’s column was\n",

      "\n",
      "Without support the British columns could do no more, and\n",
      "Lieutenant-General Drummond did not come to their support. None of the\n",
      "reports mentioned the time at which the bastion was captured; but the\n",
      "small British force, which could not have exceeded six or seven hundred\n",

      "repeatedly attempted to advance from the bastion to gain possession of\n",
      "the Fort, and twice tried to force the door of the stone mess-house\n",
      "from which the men of the Nineteenth regiment kept up a destructive\n",
      "fire. They repulsed the attacks made by reinforcements ordered by\n",

      "\n",
      "After maintaining themselves till five o’clock in this difficult\n",
      "position, the British soldiers and sailors in the bastion were\n",
      "panic-struck by the explosion of an ammunition-chest under the\n",
      "platform. According to General Drummond’s official report, “Some\n",
      "ammunition, which had been placed under the platform, caught fire\n",
      "from the firing of guns in the rear, and a most tremendous explosion\n",
      "followed, by which almost all the troops which had entered the place\n",
      "were dreadfully mangled. Panic was instantly communicated to the\n",
      "troops, who could not be persuaded that the explosion was accidental;\n",
      "and the enemy at the same time pressing forward and commencing a heavy\n",

      "said to number one hundred and ninety rank-and-file, one hundred and\n",
      "eighty-eight officers and men were reported as missing, wounded,\n",

      "under Fischer, Scott, and Drummond, numbering two thousand one hundred\n",
      "and fifty men, if the British report was correct, seven hundred and\n",
      "eighty were officially reported among the casualties. The loss in\n",
      "officers was equally severe. Colonel Scott was killed before the lines.\n",
      "Lieutenant-Colonel Drummond was killed in the bastion. One major, ten\n",
      "captains, and fifteen lieutenants were killed, wounded, or missing. The\n",

      "and unparalleled check, if not rout, from an inferior force. In a\n",
      "private letter to Prevost, dated August 16, Drummond attributed the\n",

      "and his troops returned September 9 to Castine.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Castine the British remained, while another detachment occupied\n",
      "Machias. All the province of Maine east of the Penobscot was then in\n",
      "Sherbrooke’s hands. The people formally submitted. One hundred miles\n",
      "of Massachusetts sea-coast passed quietly under the dominion of the\n",
      "King of England. The male citizens were required to take, and took, the\n",
      "oath of allegiance to King George,[149] and showed no unwillingness\n",
      "to remain permanently British subjects. After September 1 the United\n",
      "States government had every reason to expect that Great Britain would\n",
      "require, as one condition of peace, a cession of the eastern and\n",
      "northern portions of Maine.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this purpose the British needed also to occupy Lake Champlain, in\n",
      "order to make their conquests respectable. The British general might\n",
      "move on Plattsburg or on Burlington; but in order to maintain his\n",
      "position he must gain naval possession of the Lake. In such a case the\n",
      "difficulties of the American government would be vastly increased,\n",
      "and the British position would be impregnable. Armstrong knew these\n",
      "circumstances almost as well as they were known to Sir George Prevost.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May the British flotilla entered Lake Champlain from the Sorel\n",
      "River, and cruised, May 9, as far southward as Otter Creek, terrifying\n",
      "Vermont for the safety of the American flotilla under Lieutenant Thomas\n",
      "Macdonough at Vergennes. Irritated and alarmed by this demonstration,\n",
      "Armstrong ordered Izard to seize and fortify Rouse’s Point, or the\n",
      "mouth of Lacolle River, or Ash Island, and so close the entrance\n",
      "to the Lake.[150] Apparently Armstrong gave the order in ignorance\n",
      "that Lacolle River and Ash Island were strongly fortified British\n",
      "positions,[151] and that a battery established at Rouse’s Point, in\n",
      "the relative situation of forces, must have fallen into British hands.\n",
      "On this point the opinion of Izard was more valuable than that of\n",
      "Armstrong; and Izard, after much study and inquiry, decided to erect\n",
      "his fortifications at Plattsburg. He preferred the task of taking a\n",
      "position which he could certainly hold, although it would not prevent\n",
      "the enemy from passing if they chose to leave it behind them. At\n",
      "Plattsburg, therefore, he collected his troops, amounting to five or\n",
      "six thousand men, and constructed strong forts, while Macdonough’s\n",
      "fleet took position in the bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus occupied, Izard cast anxious glances westward, doubting\n",
      "whether, in case of a reverse at Niagara or Sackett’s Harbor, he ought\n",
      "not to move on the St. Lawrence and threaten the British communications\n",
      "between Montreal and Kingston.[152] The same idea occurred to\n",
      "Armstrong, who in a letter dated July 27 recommended Izard to carry\n",
      "it out.[153] The letter reached Izard August 10, when he had advanced\n",
      "with his army to Chazy, and had learned enough of the concentration of\n",
      "British troops in his front to be assured that they meant to direct\n",
      "their serious attack against Lake Champlain. He wrote Armstrong a\n",
      "letter, August 11, which failed only in saying too little, rather than\n",
      "too much, of the dangers risked in obeying Armstrong’s order:[154]--\n",
      "\n",
      "   “I will make the movement you direct, if possible; but I shall\n",
      "   do it with the apprehension of risking the force under my\n",
      "   command, and with the certainty that everything in this vicinity\n",
      "   but the lately erected works at Plattsburg and Cumberland\n",
      "   Head will in less than three days after my departure be in\n",
      "   the possession of the enemy. He is in force superior to mine\n",
      "   in my front; he daily threatens an attack on my position at\n",
      "   Champlain; we are in hourly expectation of a serious conflict.\n",
      "   That he has not attacked us before this time is attributable to\n",
      "   caution on his part, from exaggerated reports of our numbers,\n",
      "   and from his expectation of reinforcements.... It has always\n",
      "   been my conviction that the numerical force of the enemy has\n",
      "   been under-rated. I believe this to be the strong point of our\n",
      "   frontier for either attack or defence, and I know that a British\n",
      "   force has been kept in check in Lower Canada for many weeks\n",
      "   past, greatly superior to that which I could oppose to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Izard was right. Every week new British forces poured into Quebec and\n",
      "were forwarded to Montreal. The arrival of the first division at Quebec\n",
      "was announced in the American newspapers early in August. Within a few\n",
      "weeks three brigades arrived and were sent to the front. When Izard\n",
      "wrote, he was probably faced by ten thousand veteran British troops\n",
      "within twenty or thirty miles of his position, and more were known to\n",
      "be on their way. At such a moment the danger of attempting a diversion\n",
      "was great; but Armstrong refused to believe it. Irritated by Izard’s\n",
      "remonstrance, the secretary not only persisted in his own opinion, but,\n",
      "abandoning the idea of a movement against the British communications\n",
      "along the St. Lawrence, ordered Izard to march his army to Sackett’s\n",
      "Harbor, and from there to operate either directly in force against\n",
      "Kingston,[155] or to go on to Niagara and assist Brown, then hard\n",
      "pressed at Fort Erie. “It is very distinctly my opinion,” wrote the\n",
      "secretary August 12,[156] “that it has become good policy on our part\n",
      "to carry the war as far to the westward as possible, particularly while\n",
      "we have an ascendency on the Lakes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Izard obeyed. His troops, numbering four thousand men, began their\n",
      "march August 29 for Sackett’s Harbor, and for several weeks at the\n",
      "crisis of the campaign ceased to exist for military purposes. Within\n",
      "the fortifications at Plattsburg Izard left a miscellaneous body of\n",
      "three thousand, three hundred men,[157] without an organized battalion\n",
      "except four companies of the Sixth regiment. Brigadier-General\n",
      "Alexander Macomb, who as senior officer was left in command, reported\n",
      "his force as not exceeding fifteen hundred effectives.[158]\n",
      "\n",
      "Armstrong’s policy of meeting the enemy’s main attack by\n",
      "annihilating the main defence never received explanation or excuse.\n",
      "At times Armstrong seemed to suggest that he meant to rely on the\n",
      "navy,[159]--and indeed nothing else, except Izard’s forts, was left to\n",
      "rely upon; but in truth he rather invited the invasion of a British\n",
      "army into New York to “renew the scene of Saratoga.”[160] As Izard\n",
      "predicted, the enemy crossed the frontier at once after his departure,\n",
      "occupying Chazy September 3, and approaching, September 5, within eight\n",
      "miles of Plattsburg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Britain had never sent to America so formidable an armament.\n",
      "Neither Wolfe nor Amherst, neither Burgoyne nor Cornwallis, had led\n",
      "so large or so fine an army as was under the command of Sir George\n",
      "Prevost. According to his proposed arrangement, the light brigade,\n",
      "under Major-General Robinson, contained four battalions of the\n",
      "Twenty-seventh, Thirty-ninth, Seventy-sixth, and Eighty-eighth foot,\n",
      "with artillery, and numbered two thousand eight hundred and eighty-four\n",
      "rank-and-file. The second brigade, under Major-General Brisbane,\n",
      "contained battalions of the Eighth, Thirteenth, and Forty-ninth, De\n",
      "Meuron’s regiment and Canadian voltigeurs and chasseurs, numbering\n",
      "four thousand and forty-eight rank-and-file. The third brigade, under\n",
      "Major-General Power, contained battalions of the Third, Fifth,\n",
      "Twenty-seventh, and Fifty-eighth, and numbered three thousand eight\n",
      "hundred and one rank-and-file. The reserve, under Major-General Kempt,\n",
      "contained battalions of the Ninth, Thirty-seventh, Fifty-seventh, and\n",
      "Eighty-first, numbering three thousand five hundred and forty-nine\n",

      "Sixteenth and Seventieth regiments, under the command of Major-General\n",
      "DeWatteville, were stationed between Coteau du Lac and Gananoque on the\n",
      "St. Lawrence.[161]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the left division of the British army in Canada numbered fifteen\n",
      "thousand seven hundred and seventy effectives, or, including officers,\n",
      "probably eighteen thousand men, without reckoning the Canadian militia,\n",
      "either incorporated or sedentary. Two lieutenant-generals and five\n",
      "major-generals were in command. Amply provided with artillery and\n",
      "horses, every brigade well equipped, they came fresh from a long\n",
      "service in which the troops had learned to regard themselves as\n",
      "invincible. As they were at last organized, four brigades crossed\n",
      "the border, numbering not less than “eleven thousand men with a\n",
      "proportionate and most excellent train of artillery, commanded in\n",
      "chief by Sir George Prevost, and under him by officers of the first\n",
      "distinction in the service.”[162] A reserve of about five thousand men\n",
      "remained behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fleet was almost as formidable as the army. As the force of the\n",
      "flotilla was reported to Prevost, it consisted of a thirty-six-gun\n",
      "ship, the “Confiance;” an eighteen-gun brig, the “Linnet;” two ten-gun\n",
      "sloops and twelve gunboats, carrying sixteen guns,[163]--all commanded\n",
      "by Captain Downie, of the Royal Navy, detached by Sir James Yeo for the\n",
      "purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an expedition was regarded with unhesitating confidence, as able\n",
      "to go where it pleased within the region of Lake Champlain. About every\n",
      "other undertaking in America the British entertained doubts, but in\n",
      "regard to this affair they entertained none.[164] Every movement of\n",
      "the British generals showed conviction of their irresistible strength.\n",
      "Had Prevost doubted the result of attacking Plattsburg, he could have\n",
      "advanced by St. Albans on Burlington,[165] which would have obliged\n",
      "Macomb and Macdonough to leave their positions. So little did his\n",
      "army apprehend difficulty, that in advancing to Plattsburg in face of\n",
      "Macomb’s skirmishers they did not once form in line, or pay attention\n",
      "to the troops and militia who obstructed the road. “The British troops\n",
      "did not deign to fire on them except by their flankers and advanced\n",

      "of the British vessels, their weight of metal, and in the capacity and\n",
      "experience of their officers and crews.” Captain Downie informed Sir\n",
      "George Prevost’s staff-officer that he considered himself with the\n",
      "“Confiance” alone a match for the whole American squadron.[168] Taking\n",
      "the British account of the “Confiance” as correct, she was one hundred\n",
      "and forty-six feet long on the gun-deck, and thirty-six feet broad; she\n",
      "carried a crew of three hundred officers and men;[169] her armament\n",
      "was thirty-seven guns,--twenty-seven long twenty-four-pounders,\n",
      "six thirty-two-pound carronades, and four twenty-four-pound\n",
      "carronades,--throwing in all nine hundred and thirty-six pounds.[170]\n",
      "The American account, which was more trustworthy because the\n",
      "“Confiance” became better known in the American than in the British\n",
      "service, gave her thirty-one long twenty-four-pounders and six\n",
      "carronades.[171]\n",
      "\n",
      "Macdonough’s best ship was the “Saratoga.” Her dimensions were\n",
      "not recorded. Her regular complement of men was two hundred and\n",

      "twenty-four-pounders, twelve thirty-two and six forty-two-pound\n",
      "carronades,--or twenty-six guns, throwing eight hundred and\n",

      "was immense, and within carronade range it was at least sufficient to\n",

      "rear to fill the gaps. Cumberland Head on his left and front, and Crab\n",
      "Island on his right obliged the enemy to enter in a line so narrow\n",
      "that Downie would find no room to anchor on his broadside out of\n",

      "of the American long guns, and take a position within range of the\n",
      "American carronades.[173] As the battle was to be fought at anchor,\n",
      "both squadrons would as a matter of course be anchored with springs on\n",
      "their cables; but Macdonough took the additional precaution of laying\n",
      "a kedge off each bow of the “Saratoga,” bringing their hawsers in on\n",
      "the two quarters, and letting them hang in bights under water.[174]\n",
      "This arrangement enabled him to wind his ship at any time without fear\n",
      "of having his cables cut by the enemy’s shot, and to use his larboard\n",

      "Annapolis on the north, and from Washington on the northwest. Having\n",
      "arrived there August 18, Cochrane wrote, or afterward ante-dated, an\n",

      "\n",
      "The notice was the more remarkable because Cochrane’s order was issued\n",
      "only to the naval force. The army paid no attention to it. Ross’s\n",
      "troops were landed at Benedict the next day, August 19; but neither\n",
      "there nor elsewhere did they destroy or lay waste towns or districts.\n",
      "They rather showed unusual respect for private property.\n",

      "with the boats of the fleet the next day, August 20, started up the\n",

      "march at four o’clock in the afternoon abreast of the boats, and camped\n",
      "four miles above Benedict without seeing an enemy, or suffering from a\n",
      "worse annoyance than one of the evening thunder-storms common in hot\n",

      "The next day at dawn the British army started again, and marched that\n",
      "day, Sunday, August 21, twelve miles to the village of Nottingham,\n",
      "where it camped.[211] The weather was hot, and the march resembled a\n",
      "midsummer picnic. Through a thickly wooded region, where a hundred\n",
      "militia-men with axes and spades could have delayed their progress for\n",
      "days, the British army moved in a solitude apparently untenanted by\n",
      "human beings, till they reached Nottingham on the Patuxent,--a deserted\n",
      "town, rich in growing crops and full barns.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Nottingham the army passed a quiet night, and the next morning,\n",
      "Monday, August 22, lingered till eight o’clock, when it again advanced.\n",
      "Among the officers in the Eighty-fifth regiment was a lieutenant\n",
      "named Gleig, who wrote afterward a charming narrative of the campaign\n",
      "under the title, “A Subaltern in America.” He described the road as\n",
      "remarkably good, running for the most part through the heart of thick\n",
      "forests, which sheltered it from the rays of the sun. During the march\n",
      "the army was startled by the distant sound of several heavy explosions.\n",
      "Barney had blown up his gunboats to prevent their capture. The British\n",
      "naval force had thus performed its part in the enterprise, and the\n",
      "army was next to take the lead. Ross halted at Marlboro after a march\n",
      "of only seven miles, and there too he camped, undisturbed by sight\n",
      "or sound of an armed enemy, although the city of Washington was but\n",
      "sixteen miles on his left, and Baltimore thirty miles in his front.\n",
      "Ross had then marched twenty or twenty-one miles into Maryland without\n",
      "seeing an enemy, although an American army had been close on his left\n",
      "flank, watching him all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Marlboro Ross was obliged to decide what he should next do. He\n",
      "was slow in forming a conclusion. Instead of marching at day-break\n",
      "of August 23, and moving rapidly on Baltimore or Washington, the\n",
      "army passed nearly the whole day at Marlboro in idleness, as though\n",
      "it were willing to let the Americans do their utmost for defence.\n",
      "“Having advanced within sixteen miles of Washington,” Ross officially\n",
      "reported,[212] “and ascertained the force of the enemy to be such as\n",
      "might authorize an attempt to carry his capital, I determined to make\n",
      "it, and accordingly put the troops in movement on the evening of the\n",
      "23d.” More exactly, the troops moved at two o’clock in the afternoon,\n",
      "and marched about six miles on the road to Washington, when they struck\n",
      "American outposts at about five o’clock, and saw a force posted on\n",
      "high ground about a mile in their front. As the British formed to\n",
      "attack, the American force disappeared, and the British army camped\n",
      "about nine miles from Washington by way of the navy-yard bridge over\n",
      "the Eastern Branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus for five days, from August 18 to August 23, a British army, which\n",
      "though small was larger than any single body of American regulars then\n",
      "in the field, marched in a leisurely manner through a long-settled\n",
      "country, and met no show of resistance before coming within sight of\n",
      "the Capitol. Such an adventure resembled the stories of Cortez and\n",
      "De Soto; and the conduct of the United States government offered no\n",
      "contradiction to the resemblance.\n",
      "\n",
      "News of the great fleet that appeared in the Patuxent August 17 reached\n",
      "Washington on the morning of Thursday, August 18, and set the town\n",
      "in commotion. In haste the President sent fresh militia requisitions\n",
      "to the neighboring States, and ordered out the militia and all the\n",
      "regular troops in Washington and its neighborhood. Monroe started\n",
      "again as a scout, arriving in the neighborhood of Benedict at ten\n",
      "o’clock on the morning of August 20, and remaining there all day and\n",
      "night without learning more than he knew before starting.[213] Winder\n",
      "was excessively busy, but did, according to his own account, nothing.\n",
      "“The innumerably multiplied orders, letters, consultations, and\n",
      "demands which crowded upon me at the moment of such an alarm can more\n",
      "easily be conceived than described, and occupied me nearly day and\n",
      "night, from Thursday the 18th of August till Sunday the 21st, and had\n",
      "nearly broken down myself and assistants in preparing, dispensing, and\n",
      "attending to them.” Armstrong, at last alive to the situation, made\n",
      "excellent suggestions,[214] but could furnish neither troops, means,\n",
      "nor military intelligence to carry them out; and the President could\n",
      "only call for help. The single step taken for defence was taken by the\n",
      "citizens, who held a meeting Saturday evening, and offered at their own\n",
      "expense to erect works at Bladensburg. Winder accepted their offer.\n",
      "Armstrong detailed Colonel Wadsworth, the only engineer officer near\n",
      "the Department, to lay out the lines, and the citizens did such work as\n",
      "was possible in the time that remained.\n",
      "\n",
      "After three days of confusion, a force was at last evolved. Probably\n",
      "by Winder’s order, although no such order was preserved, a corps\n",
      "of observation was marched across the navy-yard bridge toward the\n",
      "Patuxent, or drawn from Bladensburg, to a place called the Woodyard,\n",
      "twelve miles beyond the Eastern Branch. The force was not to be\n",
      "despised. Three hundred infantry regulars of different regiments,\n",
      "with one hundred and twenty light dragoons, formed the nucleus; two\n",
      "hundred and fifty Maryland militia, and about twelve hundred District\n",
      "volunteers or militia, with twelve six-pound field-pieces, composed a\n",
      "body of near two thousand men,[215] from whom General Brown or Andrew\n",
      "Jackson would have got good service. Winder came out and took command\n",
      "Sunday evening, and Monroe, much exhausted, joined them that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "There the men stood Monday, August 22, while the British army marched\n",
      "by them, within sight of their outposts, from Nottingham to Marlboro.\n",
      "Winder rode forward with his cavalry and watched all day the enemy’s\n",
      "leisurely movements close in his front,[216] but the idea of attack did\n",
      "not appear to enter his mind. “A doubt at that time,” he said,[217]\n",
      "“was not entertained by anybody of the intention of the enemy to\n",
      "proceed direct to Washington.” At nine o’clock that evening Monroe sent\n",
      "a note to the President, saying that the enemy was in full march for\n",
      "Washington; that Winder proposed to retire till he could collect his\n",
      "troops; that preparations should be made to destroy the bridges, and\n",
      "that the papers in the government offices should be removed.[218] At\n",
      "the same time Monroe notified Serurier, the only foreign minister then\n",
      "in Washington, that the single hope of saving the capital depended on\n",
      "the very doubtful result of an engagement, which would probably take\n",
      "place the next day or the day after, at Bladensburg.[219]\n",
      "\n",
      "At Bladensburg, of necessity, the engagement must take place, unless\n",
      "Winder made an attack or waited for attack on the road. One of two\n",
      "courses was to be taken,--Washington must be either defended or\n",
      "evacuated. Perhaps Winder would have done better to evacuate it, and\n",
      "let the British take the undefended village; but no suggestion of the\n",
      "sort was made, nor did Winder retreat to Bladensburg as was necessary\n",
      "if he meant to unite his troops and make preparations for a battle.\n",
      "Instead of retreating to Bladensburg as soon as he was satisfied--at\n",
      "noon of Monday, August 22--that the British were going there, he\n",
      "ordered his troops to fall back, and took position at the Old Fields,\n",
      "about five miles in the rear of the Woodyard, and about seven miles\n",
      "by road from the navy-yard. Another road led from the Old Fields to\n",
      "Bladensburg about eight miles away. The American force might have been\n",
      "united at Bladensburg Monday evening, but Winder camped at the Old\n",
      "Fields and passed the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening the President and the members of the Cabinet rode out to\n",
      "the camp, and the next morning the President reviewed the army, which\n",
      "had been reinforced by Commodore Barney with four hundred sailors,\n",
      "the crews of the burned gunboats. Winder then had twenty-five hundred\n",
      "men, of whom near a thousand were regulars, or sailors even better\n",
      "fighting troops than ordinary regulars. Such a force vigorously led\n",
      "was sufficient to give Ross’s army a sharp check, and at that moment\n",
      "Ross was still hesitating whether to attack Washington. The loss of\n",
      "a few hundred men might have turned the scale at any moment during\n",
      "Tuesday, August 23; but Winder neither fought nor retreated, but once\n",
      "more passed the day on scout. At noon he rode with a troop of cavalry\n",
      "toward Marlboro. Satisfied that the enemy was not in motion and would\n",
      "not move that day, he started at one o’clock for Bladensburg, leaving\n",
      "his army to itself. He wished to bring up a brigade of militia from\n",
      "Bladensburg.[220]\n",
      "\n",
      "Winder had ridden about five miles, when the British at two o’clock\n",
      "suddenly broke up their camp and marched directly on the Old Fields.\n",
      "The American army hastily formed in line, and sent off its baggage to\n",
      "Washington. Winder was summoned back in haste, and arrived on the field\n",
      "at five o’clock as the British appeared. He ordered a retreat. Every\n",
      "military reason required a retreat to Bladensburg. Winder directed a\n",
      "retreat on Washington by the navy-yard bridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons which actuated him to prefer the navy-yard to Bladensburg,\n",
      "as explained by him, consisted in anxiety for the safety of that\n",
      "“direct and important pass,” which could not without hazard be left\n",
      "unguarded.[221] In order to guard a bridge a quarter of a mile long\n",
      "over an impassable river covered by the guns of war-vessels and the\n",
      "navy-yard, he left unguarded the open high-road which led through\n",
      "Bladensburg directly to the Capitol and the White House. After a very\n",
      "rapid retreat that “literally became a run of eight miles,”[222]\n",
      "Winder encamped in Washington near the bridge-head at the navy-yard\n",
      "at eight o’clock that night, and then rode three miles to the White\n",
      "House to report to the President. On returning to camp, he passed\n",
      "the night until three or four o’clock in the morning making in\n",
      "person arrangements to destroy the bridge “when necessary,” assuring\n",
      "his officers that he expected the enemy to attempt a passage there\n",
      "that night.[223] Toward dawn he lay down, exhausted by performing a\n",
      "subaltern’s duty all day, and snatched an hour or two of sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The British in their camp that evening were about eight miles from\n",
      "Bladensburg battle-field. Winder was about five miles distant from\n",
      "the same point. By a quick march at dawn he might still have arrived\n",
      "there, with six hours to spare for arranging his defence. He preferred\n",
      "to wait till he should know with certainty that the British were on\n",
      "their way there. On the morning of Wednesday, August 24, he wrote to\n",
      "Armstrong:[224]--\n",
      "\n",
      "   “I have found it necessary to establish my headquarters here,\n",
      "   the most advanced position convenient to the troops, and nearest\n",
      "   information. I shall remain stationary as much as possible, that\n",
      "   I may be the more readily found, to issue orders, and collect\n",
      "   together the various detachments of militia, and give them as\n",
      "   rapid a consolidation and organization as possible.... The\n",
      "   news up the river is very threatening. Barney’s or some other\n",
      "   force should occupy the batteries at Greenleaf’s Point and the\n",
      "   navy-yard. I should be glad of the assistance of counsel from\n",
      "   yourself and the Government. If more convenient, I should make\n",
      "   an exertion to go to you the first opportunity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This singular note was carried first to the President, who, having\n",
      "opened and read it, immediately rode to headquarters. Monroe, Jones,\n",
      "and Rush followed. Armstrong and Campbell arrived last. Before\n",
      "Armstrong appeared, a scout arrived at ten o’clock with information\n",
      "that the British army had broken up its camp at daylight, and was\n",
      "probably more than half way to Bladensburg.[225]\n",
      "\n",
      "Winder’s persistence in remaining at the navy-yard was explained as\n",
      "due to the idea that the enemy might move toward the Potomac, seize\n",
      "Fort Washington or Warburton, secure the passage of his ships, and\n",
      "approach the city by the river.[226] The general never explained how\n",
      "his presence at the navy-yard was to prevent such a movement if it was\n",
      "made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole eastern side of Washington was covered by a broad estuary\n",
      "called the Eastern Branch of the Potomac, bridged only at two points,\n",
      "and impassable, even by pontoons, without ample warning. From the\n",
      "Potomac River to Bladensburg, a distance of about seven miles, the\n",
      "city was effectually protected. Bladensburg made the point of a right\n",
      "angle. There the Baltimore road entered the city as by a pass; for\n",
      "beyond, to the west, no general would venture to enter, leaving an\n",
      "enemy at Bladensburg in his rear. Roads were wanting, and the country\n",
      "was difficult. Through Bladensburg the attacking army must come; to\n",
      "Bladensburg Winder must go, unless he meant to retreat to Georgetown,\n",
      "or to re-cross the Eastern Branch in the enemy’s rear. Monroe notified\n",
      "Serurier Monday evening that the battle would be fought at Bladensburg.\n",
      "Secretary Jones wrote to Commodore Rodgers, Tuesday morning, that the\n",

      "one looked instinctively to that spot[228], yet Winder to the last\n",

      "broad incline, the little straggling town of Bladensburg opposite,\n",
      "beyond a shallow stream, and hills and woods in the distance. Several\n",
      "militia corps were already camped on the ground, which had been from\n",
      "the first designated as the point of concentration. A Baltimore\n",
      "brigade, more than two thousand strong, had arrived there thirty-six\n",
      "hours before. Some Maryland regiments arrived at the same time with\n",
      "Monroe. About three thousand men were then on the field, and their\n",
      "officers were endeavoring to form them in line of battle. General\n",
      "Stansbury of the Baltimore brigade made such an arrangement as he\n",
      "thought best. Monroe, who had no military rank, altered it without\n",
      "Stansbury’s knowledge.[231] General Winder arrived at noon, and rode\n",
      "about the field. At the same time the British light brigade made its\n",
      "appearance, and wound down the opposite road, a mile away, a long\n",
      "column of redcoats, six abreast, moving with the quick regularity, of\n",
      "old soldiers,[232] and striking directly at the American centre. They\n",
      "reached the village on one side of the stream as Winder’s troops poured\n",
      "down the hill on the other; and the President with two or three of his\n",
      "Cabinet officers, considerably in advance of all their own troops,\n",
      "nearly rode across the bridge into the British line, when a volunteer\n",
      "scout warned them of their danger.[233]\n",
      "\n",
      "Much the larger portion of the American force arrived on the ground\n",
      "when the enemy was in sight, and were hastily drawn up in line wherever\n",
      "they could be placed.[234] They had no cover. Colonel Wadsworth’s\n",
      "intrenchments were not used,[235] except in the case of one field-work\n",
      "which enfiladed the bridge at close range, where field-pieces were\n",
      "placed. Although some seven thousand men were present, nothing\n",
      "deserving the name of an army existed. “A few companies only,”\n",
      "said the Subaltern, “perhaps two or at the most three battalions,\n",
      "wearing the blue jacket which the Americans have borrowed from the\n",
      "French, presented some appearance of regular troops. The rest seemed\n",
      "country-people, who would have been much more appropriately employed\n",
      "in attending to their agricultural occupations than in standing\n",
      "with muskets in their hands on the brow of a bare, green hill.”\n",
      "Heterogeneous as the force was, it would have been sufficient had it\n",
      "enjoyed the advantage of a commander.\n",
      "\n",
      "The British light brigade, some twelve or fifteen hundred men, under\n",
      "Colonel Thornton of the Eighty-fifth regiment, without waiting for the\n",
      "rear division, dashed across the bridge, and were met by a discharge of\n",
      "artillery and musketry directly in their face. Checked for an instant,\n",
      "they pressed on, crossed the bridge or waded the stream, and spread to\n",
      "the right and left, while their rockets flew into the American lines.\n",
      "Almost instantly a portion of the American line gave way; but the rest\n",
      "stood firm, and drove the British skirmishers back under a heavy fire\n",
      "to the cover of the bank with its trees and shrubs. Not until a fresh\n",
      "British regiment, moving well to the right, forded the stream and\n",
      "threatened to turn the American left, did the rout begin. Even then\n",
      "several strong corps stood steady, and in good order retired by the\n",
      "road that led to the Capitol; but the mass, struck by panic, streamed\n",
      "westward toward Georgetown and Rockville.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Barney’s sailors, though on the run, could not reach the\n",
      "field in time for the attack, and halted on the hillside, about a\n",
      "mile from Bladensburg, at a spot just outside the District line. The\n",
      "rout had then begun, but Barney put his five pieces in position and\n",
      "waited for the enemy. The American infantry and cavalry that had not\n",
      "fled westward moved confusedly past the field where the sailors stood\n",
      "at their guns. Winder sent Barney no orders, and Barney, who was not\n",
      "acting under Winder, but was commander-in-chief of his own forces under\n",
      "authority of the Navy Department, had no idea of running away. Four\n",
      "hundred men against four thousand were odds too great even for sailors,\n",
      "but a battle was not wholly disgraceful that produced such a commander\n",
      "and such men. Barney’s account of the combat was as excellent as his\n",
      "courage:[236]--\n",
      "\n",
      "   “At length the enemy made his appearance on the main road in\n",
      "   force and in front of my battery, and on seeing us made a halt.\n",
      "   I reserved our fire. In a few minutes the enemy again advanced,\n",
      "   when I ordered an eighteen-pounder to be fired, which completely\n",
      "   cleared the road; shortly after, a second and a third attempt\n",
      "   was made by the enemy to come forward, but all were destroyed.\n",
      "   They then crossed over into an open field, and attempted to\n",
      "   flank our right. He was met there by three twelve-pounders, the\n",
      "   marines under Captain Miller, and my men acting as infantry,\n",
      "   and again was totally cut up. By this time not a vestige of the\n",
      "   American army remained, except a body of five or six hundred\n",

      "right; the corps on the height broke and fled,[237] and the British,\n",
      "getting into the rear, fired down upon the sailors. The British\n",
      "themselves were most outspoken in praise of Barney’s men. “Not only did\n",
      "they serve their guns with a quickness and precision that astonished\n",
      "their assailants,” said the Subaltern, “but they stood till some of\n",
      "them were actually bayoneted with fuses in their hands; nor was it till\n",
      "their leader was wounded and taken, and they saw themselves deserted\n",
      "on all sides by the soldiers, that they left the field.” Barney held\n",
      "his position nearly half an hour, and then, being severely wounded,\n",
      "ordered his officers to leave him where he lay. There he was taken by\n",
      "the British advance, and carried to their hospital at Bladensburg.\n",
      "The British officers, admiring his gallantry, treated him, he said,\n",
      "“with the most marked attention, respect, and politeness as if I was\n",

      "Winder should have led the American army.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the sailors retired, at about four o’clock, the British stopped\n",
      "two hours to rest. Their victory, easy as it seemed, was not cheaply\n",
      "bought. General Ross officially reported sixty-four killed and one\n",
      "hundred and eighty-five wounded.[238] A loss of two hundred and fifty\n",
      "men among fifteen hundred said to be engaged[239] was not small; but\n",
      "Gleig, an officer of the light brigade, himself wounded, made twice,\n",
      "at long intervals, an assertion which he must have intended as a\n",
      "contradiction of the official report. “The loss on the part of the\n",
      "English was severe,” he said,[240] “since out of two thirds of the\n",
      "army which were engaged upward of five hundred men were killed and\n",
      "wounded.” According to this assertion, Ross lost five hundred men among\n",
      "three thousand engaged, or one in six. Had Winder inflicted that loss\n",
      "while the British were still on the Patuxent, Ross would have thought\n",
      "long before risking more, especially as Colonel Thornton was among the\n",

      "At six o’clock, after a rest of two hours, the British troops resumed\n",

      "the troops, some men, supposed to have been Barney’s sailors, fired\n",
      "on the party from the house formerly occupied by Gallatin, at the\n",
      "northeast corner of Capitol Square. Ross’s horse was killed, and the\n",

      "not enter the town, but camped at eight o’clock a quarter of a mile\n",
      "east of the Capitol. Troops were then detailed to burn the Capitol,\n",
      "and as the great building burst into flames, Ross and Cockburn, with\n",

      "attributed to them,--such as the duty of retaliation,--none of which\n",
      "was alleged by either of them as their warranty.[243] They burned the\n",

      "the early morning from the White House to the navy-yard, and thence to\n",
      "Bladensburg,--a distance of eight miles at the least. He had six miles\n",
      "to ride, on a very hot August day, over a road encumbered by fugitives.\n",

      "apparently intending to join his wife and accompany her to his\n",
      "residence at Montpelier in Loudoun County, adjoining Frederick County,\n",
      "on the south side of the Potomac. Secretary Jones, Attorney-General\n",
      "Rush, and one or two other gentlemen accompanied him. In the midst of a\n",

      "from fugitives who thought themselves betrayed. Although far beyond\n",
      "reach of the British troops and some twenty miles from their camp, the\n",
      "panic was still so great as to cause an alarm on the following night,\n",

      "less mortifying. As a scout the Secretary of State’s services were\n",
      "hardly so valuable as those of a common trooper, for he was obliged\n",
      "to be more cautious; as a general, his interference with the order of\n",

      "blundering tactician” from Armstrong.[251] After the battle he was\n",
      "not less busy, and opinions greatly differed whether he was less\n",

      "lent him a pair of pistols, which the President put in his holsters.\n",
      "Federalists were curious to know whether the pistols were the same\n",

      "Wilkinson, nor Winchester showed such incapacity as Winder either\n",
      "to organize, fortify, fight, or escape. When he might have prepared\n",
      "defences, he acted as scout; when he might have fought, he still\n",
      "scouted; when he retreated, he retreated in the wrong direction;\n",
      "when he fought, he thought only of retreat; and whether scouting,\n",
      "retreating, or fighting, he never betrayed an idea. In the brief\n",
      "moment of his preparations on the field at Bladensburg he found time\n",
      "to give the characteristic order to his artillery: “When you retreat,\n",
      "take notice that you must retreat by the Georgetown road.”[252] When\n",
      "he left the field of Bladensburg he rode past Barney’s sailors, at\n",

      "Barney’s right, with an order to retreat.[253] “After accompanying the\n",
      "retreating army within two miles of the Capitol, I rode forward for the\n",
      "purpose of selecting a position.”[254] He reached the Capitol first,\n",
      "and was presently joined there by Monroe and Armstrong. Having decided\n",
      "not to fight at the Capitol, or at any point between the Capitol and\n",
      "Georgetown, he rode to Georgetown.[255] Behind Rock Creek his army\n",
      "would have been safe, and he could certainly have rallied more than\n",
      "a thousand men to stop the panic; but he thought a farther retreat\n",
      "necessary, and went on to the heights. On the heights nothing could\n",
      "reach him without hours of warning, but he rode three miles farther to\n",
      "Tenallytown. At Tenallytown his exhausted men stopped a moment from\n",
      "inability to run farther, yet he seemed angry at their fatigue. Struck\n",
      "by a fresh panic at the glare of the burning city, he pressed his men\n",

      "supposed I collected all the force that could be gathered, I proceeded\n",
      "about five miles farther on the river road, which leads a little wide\n",
      "to the left of Montgomery Court House, and in the morning gave orders\n",
      "for the whole to assemble at Montgomery Court House.” The river road\n",
      "was the road that led farthest from the enemy westward, when every\n",
      "motive required retreat toward Baltimore if anywhere. The next morning\n",

      "from public anger by encouraging the idea that the President and the\n",

      "no longer serve under the orders or military administration of General\n",
      "Armstrong, whom they denounced as the willing cause of the fate of\n",

      "that he was greatly shaken by that disaster. He showed his prostration\n",

      "The President that evening rode to his lodgings. Madison preserved\n",
      "a memorandum of their conversation, and Armstrong also immediately\n",
      "afterward recorded what passed.[266] The President described to the\n",
      "secretary the violent prejudices which existed in the city against\n",
      "the Administration, and especially against himself and the Secretary\n",

      "something must be done.\n",

      "Armstrong replied that he was aware of the excitement, and knew its\n",
      "sources; that evidently he could not remain if his functions were\n",
      "exercised by any one else; that he would resign, or retire from\n",

      "he understood, if Madison did not, the necessary consequences of his\n",
      "retirement, and on reaching Baltimore sent his resignation to the\n",
      "President. At the same time he announced it to the public in a letter,\n",

      "conduct calculated to close their relations.\n",

      "Between conscious intrigue and unconscious instinct no clear line of\n",

      "round the city, and to erect semi-circular batteries at a number of\n",
      "points, mounted with cannon and connected by a line of works. After the\n",

      "her naval power, her commerce, and her political alliance with the\n",
      "Spanish people, and although Porter had neither a harbor of his own,\n",
      "nor the support of a diplomatic officer on the Pacific, he had nothing\n",

      "possession of the chief island in the name of his Government. That he\n",
      "should have brought away his whole crew after such relaxation, without\n",
      "desertion, was surprising. The men were for a time in a state of mutiny\n",

      "sailed, Dec. 12, 1813, for Valparaiso.\n",
      "\n",
      "Porter would have done better to sail for the China seas or the Indian\n",
      "Ocean. He knew that British war-vessels were searching for him, and\n",
      "that Valparaiso was the spot where he would be directly in their way.\n",
      "He arrived February 3, and five days afterward two British vessels\n",
      "of war sailed into the harbor, making directly for the “Essex” with\n",
      "the appearance of intending to attack and board her. The crew of the\n",
      "“Essex” stood at quarters ready to fire as the larger ship ran close\n",
      "alongside, until her yards crossed those of the “Essex,” and Porter\n",
      "probably regretted to the end of his life that he did not seize the\n",
      "opportunity his enemy gave him; but the British captain, from his\n",
      "quarter-deck only a few feet away, protested that the closeness of his\n",
      "approach was an accident, and that he intended no attack. The moment\n",
      "quickly passed, and then Porter found himself overmatched.\n",

      "The British frigate “Phœbe,” thirty-six guns, had sailed from England\n",
      "in March, 1813, under secret orders to break up the United States\n",
      "fur-establishment on the Columbia River.[288] At Rio Janeiro the\n",
      "“Phœbe” was joined by the “Cherub,” a sloop-of-war rated at eighteen\n",
      "guns, and both sailed in search of the “Essex.” The “Phœbe” was\n",
      "one hundred and forty-three and three quarters feet in length, by\n",
      "thirty-eight and a quarter in breadth; the “Essex” was one hundred and\n",
      "thirty-eight and a half feet in length, and thirty-seven and a quarter\n",
      "in breadth. The “Phœbe” carried a crew of three hundred men and boys;\n",
      "the “Essex” carried two hundred and fifty-five. The “Essex” was the\n",
      "better sailer, and the result of an action depended on her ability to\n",
      "use this advantage. The broadside of the “Essex” consisted of seventeen\n",
      "thirty-two-pound carronades and six long twelve-pounders; the “Phœbe”\n",
      "showed only eight carronades, but had thirteen long eighteen-pounders,\n",
      "one long twelve-pounder, and one long nine-pounder. At close range,\n",
      "Porter’s battery would overpower the “Phœbe’s” long guns, but the\n",
      "“Phœbe’s” thirteen long-range eighteen-pounders could destroy her enemy\n",
      "without receiving a shot in return. Porter knew all this, and knew also\n",
      "that he could not depend on Chilian protection. No British captain\n",
      "in such a situation could afford to be delicate in regard to the\n",
      "neutrality of Chili, which was not even a recognized nation. At most\n",
      "Porter could hope for immunity only in the port of Valparaiso.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Hillyar of the “Phœbe” made no mistakes. During an entire month\n",
      "he blockaded the “Essex” with his two vessels, acting with extreme\n",
      "caution. At last Porter determined to run out, trusting to a chase to\n",
      "separate the blockading cruisers; and March 28, 1814, with a strong\n",
      "southerly wind, he got under way. As he rounded the outermost point a\n",
      "violent squall carried away his maintopmast. The loss threw on Porter\n",
      "a sudden emergency and a difficult, instantaneous decision. He decided\n",
      "to return to harbor. A young midshipman, David Farragut, who made his\n",
      "first cruise in the “Essex,” gave his high authority in after years to\n",
      "the opinion that Porter’s decision was wrong. “Being greatly superior\n",
      "in sailing powers,” said Farragut, “we should have borne up, and run\n",
      "before the wind.” The chance of outsailing the “Phœbe,” or separating\n",
      "her from her consort, was better than that of regaining the anchorage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind did not allow of a return to port, and the “Essex” was run\n",
      "into a small bay three miles from Valparaiso, and anchored within\n",
      "pistol-shot of the shore. There Hillyar had her wholly at his mercy. At\n",
      "first he attacked somewhat timidly. Although Porter could bring only\n",
      "three long twelve-pounders to bear, he damaged the “Phœbe’s” rigging\n",
      "until Hillyar, in half an hour, hauled off to repair the injury,--or,\n",
      "according to Hillyar’s account, the “Phœbe” was prevented by the\n",
      "freshness of the wind from holding a position.[289] Finally the “Phœbe”\n",
      "anchored, and began firing her broadsides of long eighteen-pounders\n",
      "into the “Essex’s” quarter. The “Cherub” kept under way, using only\n",
      "her bow guns. Reply was impossible. The crew of the “Essex” fired what\n",
      "guns would bear, and got the ship under way; but the “Phœbe” kept her\n",
      "distance, throwing thirteen eighteen-pound shot into the “Essex” every\n",
      "five or ten minutes, until the “Essex” was cut to pieces and her decks\n",
      "were shambles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last attack continued, according to Captain Hillyar, from 5.35 till\n",
      "6.20 P. M., when the “Essex” struck. The entire battle lasted\n",
      "from four o’clock until the surrender. The carnage was frightful and\n",
      "useless. Porter declared that fifty-eight of his crew were killed.\n",
      "Hillyar claimed one hundred and nineteen unwounded prisoners, while\n",
      "Porter declared the number of unwounded prisoners to be seventy-five.\n",
      "The British ships, with five hundred men, lost only fifteen killed and\n",
      "wounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The loss of the “Essex,” like the loss of the “Chesapeake” and “Argus,”\n",
      "was unnecessary. Porter need not have gone to Valparaiso, or might have\n",
      "tried to run out at night, or might have fought, even after the loss\n",
      "of his maintopmast, under less disadvantage. The disaster completed\n",
      "the unfortunate record of the frigates for the year. They made some\n",
      "sixteen prizes and busied many British cruisers, but won no victories\n",
      "and suffered one bloody defeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sloops told a different story. Early in 1814 three of the new\n",
      "sloops-of-war were ready for sea,--the “Frolic,” the “Peacock,”\n",
      "and the “Wasp.” They were heavy vessels of their class, about one\n",
      "hundred and twenty feet long on the main-deck, and thirty-two feet\n",
      "in extreme breadth; carrying crews of about one hundred and sixty\n",
      "men, with an armament of twenty thirty-two-pound carronades and two\n",
      "long eighteen-pounders. Although only one third the tonnage of the\n",
      "forty-four-gun frigates, and carrying only one third the crew, the\n",
      "new sloops-of-war threw nearly half the weight of metal,--for the\n",
      "broadside of the “Constitution” commonly exceeded but little the\n",
      "weight of seven hundred pounds, while the sloops threw three hundred\n",
      "and thirty-eight. The difference was due not to the weight, but to\n",
      "the range. The frigates carried thirty long twenty-four-pounders; the\n",
      "sloops carried only two long eighteen-pounders. The sloops were rigged\n",
      "as ships, and built with the usual solidity of war-vessels, costing\n",
      "about seventy-five thousand dollars each.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first to sail was the “Frolic,” from Boston, in February. She\n",
      "captured only two prizes before she was herself taken, April 20,\n",
      "off Matanzas, after a chase by the thirty-six-gun British frigate\n",
      "“Orpheus,” assisted by a twelve-gun schooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second sloop-of-war, the “Peacock,” commanded by Lewis Warrington,\n",
      "sailed from New York in March. Warrington was a Virginian, thirty-two\n",
      "years old and fourteen years in the service, with the rank of\n",
      "master-commandant in 1813. Cruising down the coast, the “Peacock” first\n",
      "ran in to St. Mary’s on the Florida frontier; and then continuing\n",
      "southward, on the morning of April 29, off the Indian River Inlet, she\n",
      "discovered a small convoy on its way from Havana to Bermuda, under\n",
      "charge of the British eighteen-gun brig “Epervier.” The British brig\n",
      "was no match for the American ship. She was smaller, and carried only\n",
      "sixteen thirty-two and two eighteen-pound carronades, with a crew of\n",
      "one hundred and three men and fifteen boys.[290] The inferiority was\n",
      "something like four to three; but Captain Wales of the “Epervier”\n",

      "Blakeley ran directly across the ocean into soundings at the mouth\n",
      "of the British Channel. There he remained during the month of June,\n",
      "searching every vessel that passed. The number of neutrals constantly\n",
      "diverting his attention kept him actively employed, and led him farther\n",
      "into the Channel than was intended; but although three British frigates\n",
      "and fourteen sloops were at sea for the protection of British waters,\n",
      "the “Wasp” continued to burn and sink such British merchantmen as\n",
      "she met,--the first, June 2, and subsequently June 13, 18, 23, and\n",
      "26,--until on the morning of June 28 a man-of-war brig appeared to\n",
      "windward, and bore down on the American ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day was warm and overcast. During the whole morning the two vessels\n",
      "approached each other so slowly that each had more than time to study\n",
      "his opponent. Once more the foresight of the American ship-builders\n",
      "secured a decisive advantage. The British brig, the “Reindeer,” was\n",
      "altogether unequal to the contest. In tonnage she resembled the\n",
      "“Epervier,” and her armament was even lighter. Captain Manners, her\n",
      "commander, had substituted twenty-four-pound carronades for the usual\n",
      "thirty-two-pounders, and his broadside of ten guns threw only two\n",
      "hundred and ten pounds of metal,[295] while the “Wasp’s” eleven guns\n",
      "threw three hundred and thirty-eight pounds. The American crew numbered\n",
      "one hundred and seventy-three men; the British numbered one hundred\n",
      "and eighteen. Contest under such conditions was a forlorn hope, but\n",
      "the “Reindeer’s” crew were the pride of Portsmouth, and Manners was\n",
      "the idol of his men. They might cripple the “Wasp” if they could not\n",
      "capture her; and probably the fate of the “Argus,” a year before,\n",
      "encouraged the hope that the “Reindeer” could do at least as well as\n",
      "the “Pelican.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Each captain manœuvred for the weather-gauge, but the Englishman gained\n",
      "it, and coming up on the “Wasp’s” weather-quarter, repeatedly fired\n",
      "his light twelve-pound bow-carronade, filled with round and grape\n",
      "shot, into the American ship. Blakeley, “finding the enemy did not get\n",
      "sufficiently on the beam to enable us to bring our guns to bear, put\n",
      "the helm a-lee,” and fired as his guns bore. The firing began at 3.26\n",
      "P. M. and lasted until 3.40, fourteen minutes, at close range.\n",
      "In that space of time each gun in the broadside could be fired at the\n",
      "utmost three times. Apparently Manners felt that he had no chance with\n",
      "his guns, for he brought his vessel’s bow against the “Wasp’s” quarter\n",
      "and repeatedly attempted boarding. Early in the action the calves of\n",
      "his legs were shot away; then a shot passed through both his thighs;\n",
      "yet he still climbed into the rigging to lead his boarders, when two\n",
      "balls at the same moment struck him in the head. His fall ended the\n",
      "battle; and such had been the losses of his company that the highest\n",
      "officer remaining unhurt on the British brig to surrender the vessel\n",
      "was said to be the captain’s clerk. At 3.45 the “Reindeer’s” flag was\n",
      "struck,--the whole action, from the “Wasp’s” first gun, having lasted\n",
      "nineteen minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had every British vessel fought like the “Reindeer,” Englishmen would\n",
      "have been less sensitive to defeat. In this desperate action the “Wasp”\n",
      "suffered severely. Her foremast was shot through; her rigging and spars\n",
      "were much injured; her hull was struck by six round shot and much\n",
      "grape; eleven men were killed and fifteen wounded, or nearly one man in\n",
      "six, “chiefly in repelling boarders,” reported Blakeley. The “Reindeer”\n",
      "was a wreck, and was blown up as soon as the wounded could be removed.\n",
      "Of her crew, numbering one hundred and eighteen, thirty-three lost\n",
      "their lives; thirty-four were wounded,--in all, sixty-seven, or more\n",
      "than half the brig’s complement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten days afterward Blakeley ran into Lorient, where his ship was well\n",
      "received by the French, whose British antipathies were increased rather\n",
      "than lessened by their enforced submission. After refitting, the “Wasp”\n",
      "sailed again August 27, and four days later cut out a valuable ship\n",
      "from a convoy under the eyes of a seventy-four. The same evening,\n",
      "September 1, at half-past six, Blakeley sighted four vessels, two on\n",
      "either bow, and hauled up for the one most to windward. At 9.26 at\n",
      "night the chase, a brig, was directly under the “Wasp’s” lee-bow, and\n",
      "Blakeley began firing a twelve-pound bow-carronade, which he must have\n",
      "taken from the “Reindeer,” for no such gun made part of his regular\n",
      "armament.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battle in the dark which followed has been always deeply\n",
      "interesting to students of naval history, the more because the\n",
      "British Admiralty suppressed the official reports, and left an air of\n",
      "mystery over the defeat which rather magnified than diminished its\n",
      "proportions. The British brig was the sloop-of-war “Avon,” commanded\n",
      "by Captain James Arbuthnot, and carrying the usual armament of sixteen\n",
      "thirty-two-pound carronades with two long six-pounders. Her crew was\n",
      "reported as numbering one hundred and four men and thirteen boys.\n",
      "Captain Arbuthnot’s official report[296] said that the “Avon” had\n",
      "been cruising in company with the sloop-of-war “Castilian,” when at\n",
      "daylight, September 1, he “discovered an enemy’s schooner in the\n",
      "rear of the Kangaroo convoy,” and gave chase. The “Castilian” also\n",
      "gave chase, and at seven o’clock the twenty-gun ship “Tartarus” was\n",
      "signalled, also in chase.[297] All day the three British sloops-of-war\n",
      "chased the privateer schooner, until at half-past six o’clock in the\n",
      "evening the “Castilian’s” superiority in sailing free left the “Avon”\n",
      "out of sight, nine miles astern. The position of the “Tartarus” was\n",
      "not mentioned in the reports, but she could hardly have been ahead of\n",
      "the “Castilian.” The three British sloops were then within ten miles\n",
      "of each other, under full sail, with a ten-knot wind. The weather was\n",
      "hazy, and neither the “Castilian” nor the “Tartarus” could see that the\n",
      "“Avon” was signalling the “Castilian” a recall. The “Avon” saw at four\n",
      "o’clock a large sail on her weather-beam standing directly for her, and\n",
      "knowing that the “Wasp” was cruising in these waters, Captain Arbuthnot\n",
      "felt natural anxiety to rejoin his consort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Arbuthnot’s report continued:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   “The stranger closing with us fast, I kept away and set the\n",

      "   at 3 P. M. At 7.30 P. M. the stranger had\n",
      "   approached within hail, and being unable to get a satisfactory\n",
      "   answer I had not a doubt of her being an enemy’s corvette.\n",
      "   At 8.30 he fired a shot over us which was instantly returned\n",
      "   with a broadside. He then bore up and endeavored to rake us,\n",
      "   but was prevented. The action then became general within half\n",
      "   pistol-shot, and continued without intermission until 10.30\n",

      "concerned his share in the matter.[298] At nine o’clock the “Castilian”\n",
      "heard a very heavy firing in the north-northeast, and immediately\n",
      "wore and made all possible sail in that direction, burning blue\n",

      "   be done without sacrificing the lives of the surviving gallant\n",
      "   crew of our consort. Thus situated ... I was obliged ... to\n",
      "   leave the flying enemy to escape; but I feel somewhat gratified\n",
      "   the situation of the ‘Castilian’ enabled me to give him a\n",
      "   raking, and I doubt not from the closeness of the vessels a\n",
      "   most destructive broadside, which he did not return even with a\n",
      "   single gun,--a circumstance that, I trust, cannot fail to prove\n",
      "   how destructive the ‘Avon’s’ fire must have been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lieutenant Lloyd did not explain how his enemy was to bring guns to\n",

      "standing in the opposite direction, nor did he say what had become of\n",
      "the “Tartarus.” Doubtless the “Wasp” steered badly, her rigging being\n",
      "much damaged; and Blakeley was chiefly intent on keeping off till he\n",
      "could reeve new braces. The “Castilian’s” broadside cut the “Wasp’s”\n",
      "rigging and sails, and shot away a lower main cross-tree, but did no\n",
      "other serious damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “Avon” lost ten men killed and thirty-two wounded, besides being\n",
      "reduced to a sinking condition in an hour of night action in a ten-knot\n",
      "wind, with two more ships-of-war in sight and hearing. The “Wasp” lost\n",
      "two men killed and one wounded, four round shot in the hull, and the\n",
      "“rigging and sails suffered a great deal.”[299]\n",
      "\n",
      "Blakeley had done enough, and could hardly do more. Besides two\n",
      "eighteen-gun brigs, he made in his cruise fourteen prizes, which he\n",
      "destroyed, several of great value. In that year all the frigates in\n",
      "the United States service had not done as much. With a single-decked\n",
      "ship of five hundred tons, armed with carronades, Blakeley blockaded\n",
      "the British Channel for two months, capturing vessels in sight\n",
      "of ships-of-the-line, and destroying two sloops-of-war in rapid\n",
      "succession, without serious injury to himself, and to the consternation\n",
      "of the British marine.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sinking the “Avon,” September 1, Blakeley held on his course\n",
      "toward Madeira, and there, September 21, captured the brig “Atlanta,”\n",
      "which he sent to Savannah. Still later, October 9, near the Cape de\n",
      "Verde Islands, he spoke a Swedish brig, which reported him. After that\n",
      "day no word of tidings was ever received from the “Wasp.” Somewhere\n",
      "under the waters of the Atlantic, ship and crew found an unknown grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the large sloops-of-war, three smaller vessels--the\n",
      "“Syren,” “Enterprise,” and “Rattlesnake”--went to sea in 1814.\n",
      "The “Syren” was captured after a chase of eleven hours, nearly\n",
      "on a wind, by the “Medway,” seventy-four; her sixteen guns, and\n",
      "everything else that could be spared, were thrown overboard during\n",
      "the chase. The “Rattlesnake” and “Enterprise” cruised in company\n",
      "toward the West Indies, and made some prizes. The “Rattlesnake”\n",
      "was fast, the “Enterprise” a very dull sailer; but after repeated\n",
      "hairbreadth escapes, the “Rattlesnake” was caught, July 11, by the\n",
      "frigate “Leander,” with Cape Sable to windward, and was obliged to\n",
      "surrender.[300] The “Enterprise,” with her usual good fortune, was\n",
      "never taken, but became a guardship.\n",
      "\n",
      "After November 1 the United States government had not a ship at sea.\n",
      "In port, three seventy-fours were building, and five forty-fours were\n",
      "building or blockaded. Three thirty-six-gun frigates were laid up or\n",
      "blockaded. Four sloops-of-war were also in port, the “Peacock” having\n",
      "just returned from her long cruise. Such a result could not be called\n",
      "satisfactory. The few war-vessels that existed proved rather what the\n",
      "government might have done than what the British had to fear from any\n",
      "actual or probable American navy. The result of private enterprise\n",
      "showed also how much more might easily have been done by government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The year 1814 was marked by only one great and perhaps decisive success\n",
      "on either side, except Macdonough’s victory. This single success was\n",
      "privateering. Owners, captains, and crews had then learned to build\n",
      "and sail their vessels, and to hunt their prey with extraordinary\n",
      "skill. A few rich prizes stimulated the building of new vessels as\n",
      "the old were captured, and the ship-yards turned them out as rapidly\n",
      "as they were wanted. In the neighborhood of Boston, in the summer of\n",
      "1814, three companion ships were built,--the “Reindeer,” “Avon,” and\n",
      "“Blakeley;” and of these the “Reindeer” was said to have been finished\n",
      "in thirty-five working days, and all three vessels were at sea in the\n",
      "following winter. No blockade short of actual siege could prevent such\n",
      "craft from running out and in. Scores of them were constantly on the\n",
      "ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Atlantic privateers swarmed. British merchantmen were captured,\n",
      "recaptured, and captured again, until they despaired of ever reaching\n",
      "port. One British master who was three times taken and as often\n",
      "retaken, reported that he had seen ten American privateers crossing\n",
      "his course. A letter from Halifax printed in the London “Times” of\n",
      "December 19 said: “There are privateers off this harbor which plunder\n",
      "every vessel coming in or going out, notwithstanding we have three\n",
      "line-of-battle ships, six frigates, and four sloops here.” The West\n",
      "Indies and the Canaries were haunted by privateers. The “Rambler,”\n",
      "“Hyder Ali,” and “Jacob Jones” of Boston penetrated even the Chinese\n",
      "seas, and carried prize-goods into Macao and Canton. Had these pests\n",
      "confined their ravages to the colonies or the ocean, the London clubs\n",
      "and the lobbies of Parliament would have thought little about them;\n",
      "but the privateer had discovered the weakness of Great Britain, and\n",
      "frequented by preference the narrow seas which England regarded as her\n",
      "own. The quasi-blockade of the British coasts which American cruisers\n",
      "maintained in 1813 became a real and serious blockade in 1814. Few days\n",
      "passed without bringing news of some inroad into British waters, until\n",
      "the Thames itself seemed hardly safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list of privateers that hung about Great Britain and Ireland\n",
      "might be made long if the number were necessary to the story, but the\n",
      "character of the blockade was proved by other evidence than that of\n",
      "numbers. A few details were enough to satisfy even the English. The\n",
      "“Siren,” a schooner of less than two hundred tons, with seven guns and\n",
      "seventy-five men,[301] had an engagement with her Majesty’s cutter\n",
      "“Landrail” of four guns, as the cutter was crossing the British Channel\n",
      "with despatches. The “Landrail” was captured after a somewhat sharp\n",
      "action, and sent to America, but was recaptured on the way. The victory\n",
      "was not remarkable, but the place of capture was very significant;\n",
      "and it happened July 12, only a fortnight after Blakeley captured the\n",
      "“Reindeer” farther westward. The “Siren” was but one of many privateers\n",
      "in those waters. The “Governor Tompkins” burned fourteen vessels\n",
      "successively in the British Channel. The “Young Wasp” of Philadelphia\n",
      "cruised nearly six months about the coasts of England and Spain and in\n",
      "the course of West India commerce. The “Harpy” of Baltimore, another\n",
      "large vessel of some three hundred and fifty tons and fourteen guns,\n",
      "cruised nearly three months off the coast of Ireland, in the British\n",
      "Channel and in the Bay of Biscay, and returned safely to Boston filled\n",
      "with plunder, including, as was said, upward of £100,000 in British\n",
      "Treasury notes and bills of exchange. The “Leo,” a Boston schooner of\n",
      "about two hundred tons, was famous for its exploits in these waters,\n",
      "but was captured at last by the frigate “Tiber” after a chase of eleven\n",
      "hours. The “Mammoth,” a Baltimore schooner of nearly four hundred tons,\n",
      "was seventeen days off Cape Clear, the southernmost point of Ireland.\n",
      "The most mischievous of all was the “Prince of Neufchatel” of New York,\n",
      "which chose the Irish Channel as its favorite haunt, where during the\n",
      "summer it made ordinary coasting traffic impossible. The most impudent\n",
      "was probably the “Chasseur,” commanded by Captain Boyle, who cruised\n",
      "three months, and amused himself, when off the British coast, by\n",
      "sending to be posted at Lloyd’s a “Proclamation of Blockade” of “all\n",
      "the ports, harbors, bays, creeks, rivers, inlets, outlets, islands,\n",
      "and sea-coast of the United Kingdom.” The jest at that moment was too\n",
      "sardonic to amuse the British public.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the announcement of these annoyances, recurring day after day,\n",
      "became a practice of the press, the public began to grumble in louder\n",
      "and louder tones. “That the whole coast of Ireland, from Wexford round\n",
      "by Cape Clear to Carrickfergus,” said the “Morning Chronicle” of\n",
      "August 31, “should have been for above a month under the unresisted\n",
      "dominion of a few petty ‘fly-by-nights’ from the blockaded ports of the\n",
      "United States, is a grievance equally intolerable and disgraceful.”\n",
      "The Administration mouthpiece, the “Courier,” admitted, August 22,\n",
      "that five brigs had been taken in two days between the Smalls and\n",
      "the Tuskar, and that insurance on vessels trading between Ireland\n",
      "and England had practically ceased. The “Annual Register” for 1814\n",
      "recorded as “a most mortifying reflection,” that with a navy of nearly\n",
      "a thousand ships of various sizes, and while at peace with all Europe,\n",
      "“it was not safe for a vessel to sail without convoy from one part of\n",
      "the English or Irish Channel to another.” Such insecurity had not been\n",
      "known in the recent wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "As early as August 12, the London Assurance Corporations urged the\n",
      "government to provide a naval force competent to cope with the\n",
      "privateers. In September the merchants of Glasgow, Liverpool, and\n",
      "Bristol held meetings, and addressed warm remonstrances to government\n",
      "on the want of protection given to British commerce. The situation was\n",
      "serious, and the British merchants did not yet know all. Till that time\n",
      "the East India and China trade had suffered little, but at last the\n",
      "American privateers had penetrated even the Chinese seas; and while\n",
      "they were driving the British flag into port there, they attacked the\n",
      "East India Company’s ships, which were really men-of-war, on their\n",
      "regular voyages. In August the “Countess of Harcourt” of more than five\n",
      "hundred tons, carrying six heavy guns and ninety men, was captured in\n",
      "the British Channel by the privateer “Sabine” of Baltimore, and sent\n",
      "safely to America. The number and value of the prizes stimulated new\n",
      "energy in seeking them, and British commerce must soon yield to that of\n",
      "neutral nations if the war continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "The merchants showed that a great change had come over their minds\n",
      "since they incited or permitted the Tories to issue the Impressment\n",
      "Proclamation and the Orders in Council seven years before. More than\n",
      "any other class of persons, the ship-owners and West India merchants\n",
      "were responsible for the temper which caused the war, and they were\n",
      "first to admit their punishment. At the Liverpool meeting, where Mr.\n",
      "Gladstone, who took the chair, began by declaring that some ports,\n",
      "particularly Milford, were under actual blockade,[302] a strong\n",
      "address was voted; and at a very numerous meeting of merchants,\n",
      "manufacturers, ship-owners, and underwriters at Glasgow, September 7,\n",

      "“Constitution” lost only seventy-eight men altogether. The “Macedonian”\n",
      "lost only one hundred and four. The attack on the “General Armstrong”\n",

      "   resorted to to renew the contest; and they succeeded in again\n",
      "   getting alongside, but not in the position intended. Their\n",
      "   failure, therefore, is to be ascribed in the first instance\n",
      "   to the velocity of the tide, the height of the vessel’s side,\n",
      "   not having channel plates to assist the men in getting on her\n",

      "mounted; and at last more than half the British party were killed or\n",
      "captured. According to the British account, twenty-eight men, including\n",
      "the first lieutenant of the “Endymion,” were killed; and thirty-seven\n",
      "men, including the second lieutenant, were wounded.[313] This report\n",
      "did not quite agree with that of the privateer, which claimed also\n",

      "unhurt. In any case, more than seventy men of the “Endymion’s” crew,\n",

      "their own judgment of the future; yet shrewd observers, little affected\n",
      "either by emotion or by interest, inclined to the belief that the\n",

      "First, in regard to money. In July, Secretary Campbell advertised a\n",

      "him to give the same terms to the contractors who had taken the nine\n",
      "millions subscribed in the spring at eighty-eight. Barker found\n",

      "bankruptcy, long foreseen, at length occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "The panic caused by the capture of Washington, August 24, obliged\n",
      "the tottering banks of Philadelphia and Baltimore to suspend specie\n",
      "payments. The banks of Philadelphia formally announced their\n",
      "suspension, August 31, by a circular explaining the causes and\n",
      "necessity of their decision.[315] The banks of New York immediately\n",
      "followed, September 1; and thenceforward no bank between New Orleans\n",
      "and Albany paid its obligations except in notes. Only the banks of\n",
      "New England maintained specie payments, with the exception of those\n",
      "in least credit, which took the opportunity to pay or not pay as\n",
      "they pleased. The suspension was admitted to be permanent. Until the\n",
      "blockade should be raised and domestic produce could find a foreign\n",
      "market, the course of exchange was fixed, and specie payments could\n",
      "not be resumed. The British navy and the Boston Federalists held the\n",
      "country firmly bound, and peace alone could bring relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suspension mattered little, and had the National Bank been in existence\n",
      "the failure might have been an advantage to the government; but without\n",
      "a central authority the currency instantly fell into confusion. No\n",
      "medium of exchange existed outside of New England. Boston gave the\n",
      "specie standard, and soon the exchanges showed wide differences.\n",
      "New York money stood at twenty per cent discount, Philadelphia at\n",
      "twenty-four per cent, Baltimore at thirty per cent. Treasury notes\n",
      "were sold in Boston at twenty-five per cent discount, and United\n",
      "States six-per-cents stood at sixty in coin.[316] The Treasury had no\n",
      "means of transferring its bank deposits from one part of the country\n",
      "to another. Unless it paid its debts in Treasury notes, it was unable\n",
      "to pay them at all. No other money than the notes of suspended banks\n",
      "came into the Treasury. Even in New England, taxes, customs-duties,\n",
      "and loans were paid in Treasury notes, and rarely in local currency.\n",
      "Thus, while the government collected in the Middle and Southern States\n",
      "millions in bank-notes, it was obliged to leave them in deposit at the\n",
      "local banks where the collection was made, while its debts in Boston\n",
      "and New York remained unpaid. The source of revenue was destroyed. The\n",
      "whole South and West, and the Middle States as far north as New York,\n",
      "could contribute in no considerable degree to the support of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation was unusual. The government might possess immense\n",
      "resources in one State and be totally bankrupt in another; it might\n",
      "levy taxes to the amount of the whole circulating medium, and yet\n",
      "have only its own notes available for payment of debt; it might\n",
      "borrow hundreds of millions and be none the better for the loan. All\n",
      "the private bank-notes of Pennsylvania and the Southern country were\n",
      "useless in New York and New England where they must chiefly be used. An\n",
      "attempt to transfer such deposits in any quantity would have made them\n",
      "quite worthless. The Treasury already admitted bankruptcy. The interest\n",
      "on the national obligations could not be paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President’s second inquiry regarded men. The new Secretary of War,\n",
      "Monroe, gave him such information as the Department possessed on the\n",
      "numbers of the army. A comparative account showed that in June, 1813,\n",
      "the regular troops numbered 27,609; in December, 34,325. In January,\n",
      "1814, the number was nominally 33,822;[317] in July the aggregate was\n",
      "31,503, the effectives being 27,010.[318] Since July the recruits had\n",
      "declined in numbers. The three months of March, April, and May produced\n",
      "6,996 recruits; the three months of July, August, and September were\n",
      "reported as furnishing 4,477.[319] The general return of September 30\n",
      "reported the strength of the army at 34,029 men.[320] The government\n",
      "was not able to provide the money necessary to pay bounties due for\n",
      "the last three months’ recruiting.[321] The Secretary of War admitted\n",
      "the failure of the recruiting service, and attributed it to the high\n",
      "bounties given for substitutes in the militia detached for United\n",
      "States service.[322]\n",
      "\n",
      "The smallness of the armies in the field showed worse results than\n",
      "were indicated by the returns. Macomb at Plattsburg claimed to have\n",
      "only fifteen hundred effectives. Izard carried with him to Buffalo\n",
      "only four thousand men. Brown’s effectives at Fort Erie numbered two\n",
      "thousand. Apparently these three corps included the entire force in the\n",
      "field on the Canada frontier, and their combined effective strength did\n",
      "not exceed eight thousand men. The year before, Wilkinson and Hampton\n",
      "commanded fully eleven thousand effectives in their movements against\n",
      "Montreal. Nothing showed that the victories at Niagara and Plattsburg\n",
      "had stimulated enlistments, or that the army could be raised above\n",
      "thirty thousand effectives even if the finances were in a condition to\n",
      "meet the expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much was said of the zeal shown by the State militia in hastening to\n",
      "the defence of their soil, and the New England Federalists were as\n",
      "loud as the Kentucky and Tennessee Democrats in praise of the energy\n",
      "with which the militia rose to resist invasion; but in reality this\n",
      "symptom was the most alarming of the time. Both in the military and in\n",
      "the political point of view, the persistence in depending on militia\n",
      "threatened to ruin the national government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The military experience of 1814 satisfied the stanchest war Democrats\n",
      "that the militia must not be their dependence. In Maine the militia\n",
      "allowed themselves with hardly a show of resistance to be made\n",
      "subjects of Great Britain. At Plattsburg volunteers collected in\n",
      "considerable numbers, but the victory was won by the sailors and the\n",
      "engineers. At Niagara, Brown never could induce more than a thousand\n",
      "volunteers to support him in his utmost straits. Porter’s efforts\n",
      "failed to create a brigade respectable in numbers, and at Chippawa\n",
      "his Indians outnumbered his whites. Four days after the repulse\n",
      "of Drummond’s assault on Fort Erie, at the most anxious moment\n",
      "of the Niagara campaign, Major-General Brown wrote to Secretary\n",
      "Armstrong,[323]--\n",
      "\n",
      "   “I very much doubt if a parallel can be found for the state\n",
      "   of things existing on this frontier. A gallant little army\n",
      "   struggling with the enemies of their country, and devoting their\n",
      "   lives for its honor and its safety, left by that country to\n",
      "   struggle alone, and that within sight and within hearing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A month afterward Brown succeeded in obtaining a thousand volunteers,\n",
      "and by some quality of his own made them assault and carry works that\n",
      "old soldiers feared to touch. The feat was the most extraordinary that\n",
      "was performed on either side in the remarkably varied experience of the\n",
      "war; but it proved Brown’s personal energy rather than the merits of a\n",
      "militia system. At Washington the militia were thoroughly tested; their\n",
      "rout proved chiefly the incompetence of their general, but the system\n",
      "was shown, before the battle, to be more defective than the army it\n",
      "produced. At Baltimore the militia were again routed, and the town was\n",
      "saved chiefly by the engineers and sailors. In Virginia, where more\n",
      "than forty thousand militia were in the field, they protected nothing,\n",
      "and their service was more fatal to themselves than though they had\n",
      "fought severe battles. Nearly all the Virginia militia summoned for\n",
      "the defence of Norfolk suffered from sickness, and the mortality\n",
      "when compared with that of the regular service was enormous; five\n",
      "militia-men sickened and died where one regular soldier suffered.[324]\n",
      "In Tennessee and Georgia the experience was equally unfortunate; the\n",
      "Georgia militia could do nothing with the Creeks, and Andrew Jackson\n",
      "himself was helpless until he obtained one small regiment of regulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides its military disadvantages the militia service was tainted with\n",
      "fraud. Habitually and notoriously in New England and New York, the\n",
      "militia-men when called out attended muster, served a few days in order\n",
      "to get their names on the pay-roll, and then went home. The United\n",
      "States government wasted millions of dollars in pay and pensions for\n",
      "such men. Another source of waste was in the time required to place\n",
      "them in the field. The government struggled to avoid a call of militia,\n",
      "even though risking great disasters by the neglect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst of all evils lay still further in the background. The militia\n",
      "began by rendering a proper army impossible, and ended by making\n",
      "government a form. The object of Massachusetts in praising the conduct\n",
      "of militia, and in maintaining its own at a high state of efficiency,\n",
      "was notorious. The Federalists knew that the national government must\n",
      "sooner or later abandon the attempt to support an army. When that\n",
      "time should come, the only resource of the government would lie in\n",
      "State armies, and Massachusetts was the best equipped State for that\n",
      "object. Her militia, seventy thousand strong, well-armed, well-drilled,\n",
      "and as yet untouched by war, could dictate to the Union. Whenever\n",
      "Massachusetts should say the word, the war must stop; and Massachusetts\n",
      "meant to say the word when the government fairly ceased to possess\n",
      "either money or arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "That moment, in the belief of the Massachusetts Federalists, had come.\n",
      "Their course in the summer and autumn of 1814 left no doubt of their\n",
      "intentions. No act of open rebellion could be more significant than\n",
      "their conduct when Sherbrooke’s expedition occupied Castine. Then\n",
      "at last Governor Strong consented to call out the militia, which he\n",
      "refused to do two years before, because, he asserted, Castine and the\n",
      "other coast towns were sufficiently defended;[325] but the governor was\n",
      "careful to avoid the suspicion that these troops were in the national\n",
      "service. He acted independently of the national government in the\n",
      "terms of his general order of September, 1814,[326] placing his militia\n",
      "under the command of a major-general of their own, and making only\n",
      "a bare inquiry of the Secretary of War whether their expenses would\n",
      "be reimbursed,[327]--an inquiry which Monroe at once answered in the\n",
      "negative.[328] The force was a State army, and could not fail to cause\n",
      "the President more anxiety than it was likely ever to cause the Prince\n",
      "Regent.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time the governor of Connecticut withdrew from the command\n",
      "of Brigadier-General Cushing the brigade of State militia then in the\n",
      "national service, and placed it under a major-general of State militia,\n",
      "with injunctions to obey no orders except such as were issued by State\n",
      "authority.[329] The evil of these measures was greatly aggravated\n",
      "by coinciding with the crisis which stopped the course of national\n",
      "government. Connecticut withdrew her militia, August 24; Washington was\n",
      "captured the same day; the Philadelphia banks suspended payment August\n",
      "29; Castine was taken August 31; and Governor Strong called out the\n",
      "Massachusetts militia September 6. The government was prostrate, and\n",
      "New England was practically independent when Sir George Prevost crossed\n",
      "the frontier, September 3. So complete was the paralysis that Governor\n",
      "Chittenden of Vermont, on receiving official notice[330] that the\n",
      "British army and navy were advancing on Lake Champlain, refused to call\n",
      "out the militia, because neither the Constitution nor the laws gave him\n",
      "authority to order the militia out of the State.[331] He could only\n",
      "recommend that individuals should volunteer to assist in the defence of\n",
      "Plattsburg. Chittenden’s conduct was the more suggestive because of his\n",
      "undoubted honesty and the absence of factious motive for his refusal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The full meaning of Governor Strong’s course was avowed a few days\n",
      "afterward. Having called a special meeting of the State legislature\n",
      "for October 5, he addressed to it a message narrating the steps he had\n",
      "taken, and the refusal of the President to assume the expenses of the\n",
      "militia called into service for the defence of the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “The situation of this State is peculiarly dangerous and\n",
      "   perplexing,” said Governor Strong;[332] “we have been led by the\n",
      "   terms of the Constitution to rely on the government of the Union\n",
      "   to provide for our defence. We have resigned to that government\n",
      "   the revenues of the State with the expectation that this object\n",
      "   would not be neglected.... Let us then, relying on the support\n",
      "   and direction of Providence, unite in such measures for our\n",
      "   safety as the times demand and the principles of justice and the\n",
      "   law of self-preservation will justify.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sense which this invitation was intended to bear could be best\n",
      "understood by appreciating the temper of the body thus addressed and\n",
      "the time when the appeal was made. The national government had for\n",
      "practical purposes ceased. The Boston “Centinel,” a newspaper of large\n",
      "circulation, said to reach six thousand copies, announced September 10,\n",
      "1814, that the Union was already practically dissolved, and that the\n",
      "people must rise in their majesty, protect themselves, and compel their\n",
      "unworthy servants to obey their will. Governor Strong knew that the\n",
      "legislature was controlled by extreme partisans of the Pickering type,\n",
      "who wished, to use his phrase, to “let the ship run aground.” Even\n",
      "Josiah Quincy, one of the most vehement Federalists, was aware that the\n",
      "members of the General Court stood in danger of doing too much rather\n",
      "than too little.[333]\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong’s message of October 5 was echoed by Pickering from Washington,\n",
      "October 12, in a letter which closed with the exhortation to seize the\n",
      "national revenues:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   “As, abandoned by the general government except for taxing us,\n",
      "   we must defend ourselves, so we ought to secure and hold fast\n",

      "   provide for the indispensable duty of self-defence, it must soon\n",
      "   become impossible for them to sustain this burden. There remains\n",
      "   to them therefore no alternative but submission to the enemy, or\n",
      "   the control of their own resources to repel his aggressions. It\n",
      "   is impossible to hesitate in making the election. This people\n",

      "The report further showed that the United States Constitution had\n",
      "failed to secure to New England the rights and benefits expected from\n",

      "means of producing it.[336] As Otis’s committee presented the subject,\n",
      "the conference was in the first place to devise some mode of common\n",
      "defence; and, in the second, “to lay the foundation for a radical\n",

      "chosen by any or all of the other New England States upon our public\n",
      "grievances and concerns.” The choice was marked by a conservative\n",

      "The remonstrances and threats of the minority made the majority\n",

      "commonly accepted; and his rule that a President’s responsibility\n",
      "ceased after giving an order, besides ignoring the President’s\n",
      "responsibility for the selection of agents, seemed to destroy the\n",
      "foundation of the public service. “I never doubted that the plans\n",

      "retained permanent value. The Virginians were willing to throw off\n",
      "responsibility for public disaster; and they naturally threw it\n",

      "   “Some apprehend danger from the defection of Massachusetts. It\n",

      "   become neutral, we are sufficient for one enemy without them,\n",
      "   and in fact we get no aid from them now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably most Virginians shared this belief, at least so far as\n",
      "concerned the aid rendered by Massachusetts to the war. In truth,\n",
      "Massachusetts gave little aid, and made a profession of her wish to\n",
      "give none at all; but the difficulty did not end there. Massachusetts\n",
      "and Virginia were States of the first class. The census of 1810\n",
      "allotted to Massachusetts, including Maine, a population of about seven\n",
      "hundred thousand; to Virginia, a white population of five hundred\n",
      "and fifty-one thousand, and a colored population of four hundred and\n",
      "twenty-three thousand,--nine hundred and seventy-four thousand in\n",
      "all. In the ratio of representation Massachusetts counted for twenty,\n",
      "Virginia for twenty-three. The quota of Massachusetts in the direct tax\n",
      "was $316,000; that of Virginia was $369,000. On the scale furnished\n",
      "by these data, Virginia should have contributed in support of the war\n",
      "about one eighth or one seventh more men and money than were required\n",
      "from Massachusetts. The actual result was different.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of money contributed by Massachusetts could not be compared\n",
      "with that contributed by Virginia, partly because of the severe\n",
      "blockade which closed the Virginian ports. The net revenue from customs\n",
      "derived from Virginia in 1814 was $4,000; that from Massachusetts was\n",
      "$1,600,000.[349] Unlike the customs revenue, the receipts from internal\n",
      "revenue were supposed to be reasonably equalized, so that each State\n",
      "should contribute in due proportion. According to the official return,\n",
      "dated Nov. 24, 1815, the total internal duties which had then been paid\n",
      "to the collectors for the year 1814 in Massachusetts was $198,400; in\n",
      "Virginia it was $193,500. The total amount then paid to the Treasury\n",
      "was $178,400 in Massachusetts, and $157,300 in Virginia.[350] The\n",
      "direct tax was fixed by Congress and was assumed by the State in\n",
      "Virginia, but regularly assessed in Massachusetts. One paid $316,000;\n",
      "the other, $369,000. The total revenue derived from Massachusetts was\n",
      "therefore $2,114,400 in the year 1814; that from Virginia, $566,500. Of\n",
      "the loans effected in the same year, Massachusetts took a small part\n",
      "considering her means,--hardly a million dollars. Virginia took still\n",
      "less,--only two hundred thousand.[351]\n",
      "\n",
      "In money, Massachusetts contributed four times as much as Virginia to\n",
      "support the war, and her contributions were paid in Treasury notes or\n",
      "paper equivalent to coin,--not in the notes of banks worthless beyond\n",
      "the State. In men, the estimate was affected by the inquiry whether the\n",
      "militia were to be considered as protecting the national government\n",
      "or the State. Owing to the presence of the British in the Chesapeake,\n",
      "Virginia kept a large force of militia on foot, some of which were\n",
      "in garrison at Norfolk, and a few were on the field of Bladensburg.\n",
      "Massachusetts also was obliged to call out a considerable force of\n",
      "militia to protect or garrison national posts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relative numbers of regular troops were also somewhat doubtful;\n",
      "but the paymaster of the army reported Oct. 26, 1814, that he had\n",
      "distributed in bounties during the year $237,400 for Massachusetts, and\n",
      "$160,962 for Virginia.[352] During the year, six regular regiments--the\n",
      "Ninth, Twenty-first, Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth, Fortieth, and\n",
      "Forty-fifth--recruited in Massachusetts. Three--the Twelfth, Twentieth,\n",
      "and Thirty-fifth--recruited in Virginia. Perhaps the military aid\n",
      "furnished by the different sections of the seaboard could be better\n",
      "understood by following the familiar divisions. New England furnished\n",
      "thirteen regiments. New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania furnished\n",
      "fifteen. The Southern States, from Delaware to South Carolina\n",
      "inclusive, furnished ten. Of all the States in the Union New York alone\n",
      "supplied more regular soldiers than Massachusetts, and Massachusetts\n",
      "supplied as many as were furnished by Virginia and the two Carolinas\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judged by these standards, either Massachusetts had done more than\n",
      "her share, or Virginia had done less than hers. The tests were\n",
      "material, and took no moral element in account; but in moral support\n",
      "the relative failure of Massachusetts was not beyond dispute. Public\n",
      "opinion in New England was almost equally divided, and the pronounced\n",
      "opposition to the war was much greater in the Eastern States than in\n",
      "the Southern; but in the serious work of fighting, New England claimed\n",
      "a share of credit. In the little army at Niagara New York supplied\n",
      "the Major-General, Virginia and Massachusetts the two brigadiers;\n",
      "but Winfield Scott’s brigade was chiefly composed of New England\n",
      "men; and when, nearly half a century afterward, Scott in his old\n",
      "age was obliged to choose between his allegiance to his State and\n",
      "allegiance to the Union, the memory of the New England troops who had\n",
      "won for him his first renown had its influence in raising his mind\n",
      "above the local sympathies which controlled other Virginia officers.\n",
      "Without reflecting on Virginia courage or patriotism, the New England\n",
      "Republicans were warranted in claiming that not the Virginia regiments,\n",
      "but the Massachusetts Ninth, the Vermont Eleventh, the Massachusetts\n",
      "Twenty-first, and the Connecticut Twenty-fifth routed the Royal Scots\n",
      "at Chippawa, and bayoneted the British artillery-men at Lundy’s Lane,\n",
      "and stormed Drummond’s intrenchments at Fort Erie. They could add that\n",
      "without their sailors the war might have been less successful than it\n",
      "was; and they would have been justified had they asked Jefferson to\n",
      "glance at his latest newspaper as he wrote that Massachusetts gave no\n",
      "aid to the war, and read the despatch of Johnston Blakeley reporting\n",
      "that the New England crew of the “Wasp” had sunk the “Avon” in the\n",
      "middle of a British fleet.[353] Virginians did not take kindly to the\n",

      "local. He might have disregarded the conduct of the State governments\n",
      "of Massachusetts and Connecticut had he enjoyed the full support of\n",
      "his own great Republican States, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North\n",

      "Again and again, from the beginning of the troubles with England,\n",

      "nearly twenty millions from the Treasury between January and July;\n",
      "twenty-seven millions more were payable between July and the following\n",

      "amount approaching it.\n",
      "\n",
      "July 1 the Treasury contained $4,722,000. From its various sources of\n",

      "For the year 1815 the revenue in all its branches might produce\n",

      "   even certain that the establishing and pledging of revenues\n",
      "   adequate to the punctual payment of the interest and eventual\n",
      "   reimbursement of the principal of the sums which will be\n",

      "more than four millions would fall due before December 31. Campbell\n",
      "considered that six millions in Treasury notes was about as large\n",
      "a sum as could easily be circulated, but by issuing notes of small\n",
      "denominations he hoped to raise the amount to ten millions.\n",
      "\n",
      "From all sources Campbell hoped to obtain about twenty-four million\n",
      "dollars of the seventy-four millions required. For the remaining\n",
      "fifty millions he had no suggestion to offer. The means for new and\n",
      "extraordinary exertions, he said, “ought to be provided.” He declared\n",
      "that the resources of the nation were ample,--which was true, but was\n",
      "also the most discouraging symptom of the time; for if the people,\n",
      "with ample resources, as he asserted, refused to come to the support\n",
      "of their own government on any terms, their decision must be accepted\n",
      "as final. Besides throwing upon Congress all these difficulties,\n",
      "without a suggestion of his own, Campbell added that Congress would be\n",
      "required to exert its powers to remedy the evils of the currency and\n",
      "the suspension of specie payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress on hearing this financial statement regarded the situation\n",

      "willing to submit to his Philadelphia lawyer for head of the Treasury.\n",
      "The public patient is so very sick that we must swallow anything,\n",
      "however nauseous.” Dallas was nominated October 5, and confirmed the\n",
      "next day without opposition, as Secretary of the Treasury. No stronger\n",
      "proof could have been given of the helplessness of Congress, for Dallas\n",
      "was a man who under no other circumstances could have obtained a ray of\n",
      "popular favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dallas’s character was high, his abilities undoubted, his experience\n",
      "large; but for ten years he had been one of the least popular men\n",
      "in Pennsylvania, the target of newspaper abuse and the champion of\n",
      "political independence. The people reasonably required that their\n",
      "leaders should more or less resemble some popular type, and if the\n",
      "result was monotonous the fault was in the society, not in its politics\n",
      "or its politicians; but Dallas was like no ordinary type in any people.\n",
      "His tone of intellectual and social superiority, his powdered hair,\n",
      "old-fashioned dress and refined manners, his free habits of expense,\n",
      "and the insubordination even more than the vivacity of his temper\n",
      "irritated the prejudices of his party.[355] He had little respect\n",
      "for Presidents, and none for Congress. For Jefferson and Virginia\n",
      "doctrines he felt distrust, which was returned. Earnest in temper and\n",
      "emphatic in tone, even to the point of tears and tropical excitability,\n",
      "Dallas came to Washington as though to lead a forlorn hope,--caring\n",
      "little for parties and less for ambition, but bent upon restoring to\n",
      "the government the powers that his friend Gallatin, too easily as he\n",
      "thought, had allowed to slip from its grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difficulties of the Treasury when Dallas took charge of it were\n",
      "not easily exaggerated. His own description,[356] given some six weeks\n",
      "afterward, made no disguise of them. “The Treasury,” he said, “was\n",
      "suffering under every kind of embarrassment. The demands upon it were\n",
      "great in amount, while the means to satisfy them were comparatively\n",
      "small, precarious in collection, and difficult in their application....\n",
      "The means consisted, first, of the fragment of an authority to borrow\n",
      "money when nobody was disposed to lend, and to issue Treasury notes\n",
      "which none but necessitous creditors or contractors in distress ...\n",
      "seemed willing to accept;” second, of bank-credits, chiefly in the\n",
      "South and West, rendered largely useless by the suspension of specie\n",
      "payments; third, of the current receipts of taxes, also useless because\n",
      "paid chiefly in Treasury notes. The Treasury was bankrupt. The formal\n",
      "stoppage of payments in interest on the debt was announced, November\n",
      "9, by an official letter from the secretary, notifying holders of\n",
      "government securities in Boston that the Treasury could not meet its\n",
      "obligations, and that “the government was unable to avert or to control\n",
      "this course of events.”[357] After that date the Treasury made no\n",
      "further pretence of solvency.\n",

      "From this situation the government could be rescued only by a great\n",
      "effort; and obviously the currency must be first restored, for\n",
      "until some system of exchange could be established, every increase\n",
      "of taxation would merely increase unavailable bank deposits. Fifty\n",
      "millions of Southern bank-notes, locked in the vaults of Southern\n",
      "banks, would not pay the over-due interest on government bonds at\n",
      "Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this subject every one turned, but the schemes that seemed to have\n",
      "a chance of adoption were only two. The first came from President\n",
      "Jefferson, and was strongly pressed by the South. As Jefferson\n",
      "explained it, the plan seemed as simple as his plans were apt to\n",
      "be; he proposed to issue twenty millions in promissory notes every\n",
      "year as long as might be necessary. “Our experience,” he told the\n",
      "President,[358] “has proved it [a paper currency] may be run up to two\n",
      "or three hundred millions without more than doubling what would be the\n",
      "prices of things under a sufficient medium, or say a metallic one.” His\n",
      "plan included an increase of taxation by two million dollars every year\n",
      "to redeem the same amount of Treasury issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously the insuperable obstacle to this plan was the paper money\n",
      "of the State banks, which already stood at discounts varying from ten\n",
      "to fifty per cent in specie, and in any large quantity could not be\n",
      "discounted at all. Until private paper should be abolished, public or\n",
      "government paper could not be brought into common use. Jefferson’s\n",
      "views on this, as on the whole subject, were interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “The banks have discontinued themselves,” he explained.[359]\n",
      "   “We are now without any medium; and necessity, as well as\n",
      "   patriotism and confidence, will make us all eager to receive\n",
      "   Treasury notes if founded on specific taxes. Congress may now\n",
      "   borrow of the public, and without interest, all the money they\n",
      "   may want, to the amount of a competent circulation, by merely\n",
      "   issuing their own promissory notes of proper denominations for\n",
      "   the larger purposes of circulation, but not for the small. Leave\n",
      "   that door open for the entrance of metallic money.... The State\n",
      "   legislatures should be immediately urged to relinquish the right\n",
      "   of establishing banks of discount. Most of them will comply on\n",
      "   patriotic principles, under the convictions of the moment; and\n",
      "   the non-complying may be crowded into concurrence by legitimate\n",
      "   devices.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of “banks of discount,” Jefferson probably meant to say banks\n",
      "of issue, although the Virginia school was hostile to all banks, and\n",
      "possibly he wished to destroy the whole system. If the scheme were\n",
      "adopted, twenty million dollars in paper money would not supply the\n",
      "wants of the Treasury, which required at least fifty millions within a\n",
      "year. The resource was limited, even if the States could be compelled\n",
      "to stop the issue of private notes,--which was extremely doubtful in\n",
      "the temper of Massachusetts and with the leanings of Chief-Justice\n",
      "Marshall. Jefferson did not touch upon legal tender; but the assumption\n",
      "of power implied in the issue of paper money seemed to require that\n",
      "the government should exercise the right of obliging its creditors to\n",
      "accept it. The actual interest-bearing Treasury notes stood then at\n",
      "a discount of about twenty per cent. The proposed paper money could\n",
      "hardly circulate at a better rate, and coin was not to be obtained.\n",
      "Under such conditions the notes must be a forced currency if they were\n",
      "to circulate at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scheme was reported to the House by the Committee of Ways and Means\n",
      "through its chairman, John W. Eppes, Jefferson’s son-in-law.[360] For\n",
      "the report Eppes was alone responsible, and the plan in his hands\n",
      "varied in some points from that of Jefferson. Starting from the\n",
      "admitted premise that loans were not to be obtained, and that money\n",
      "could not be transferred from one point to another in any existing\n",
      "medium at the disposition of government, Eppes proposed to issue\n",
      "Treasury notes “in sums sufficiently small for the ordinary purposes\n",
      "of society,” which were not to be made payable on demand in coin, but\n",
      "might at any time be exchanged for eight per cent bonds, and were to\n",
      "be received “in all payments for public lands and taxes.” Nothing was\n",
      "said of legal tender, or of driving bank-notes from circulation; but\n",
      "Eppes proposed to double the taxes at one stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eppes’s scheme lost the advantages of Jefferson’s without gaining any\n",
      "of its own. It abandoned the hope of abolishing bank paper; and in want\n",
      "of such a restraint on private issues, the proposed government paper\n",
      "would merely add one more element of confusion to the chaos already\n",
      "existing. Eppes further altered Jefferson’s plan by adding some ten\n",
      "millions instead of two millions to the burden of taxation; but even\n",
      "Jefferson protested that this part of the scheme was impracticable.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “This is a dashing proposition,” he wrote to Monroe;[361] “but\n",
      "   if Congress pass it, I shall consider it sufficient evidence\n",
      "   that their constituents generally can pay the tax. No man has\n",
      "   greater confidence than I have in the spirit of the people to\n",
      "   a rational extent. Whatever they can, they will. But without\n",
      "   either market or medium, I know not how it is to be done. All\n",
      "   markets abroad and all at home are shut to us, so that we have\n",
      "   been feeding our horses on wheat. Before the day of collection,\n",
      "   bank-notes will be but as oak-leaves; and of specie there is not\n",
      "   within all the United States one half of the proposed amount of\n",
      "   the taxes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the situation of the Virginia scheme when Dallas took the\n",
      "matter in hand. Immediately after entering into office, Dallas wrote to\n",
      "Eppes an official letter, dated October 17, expressing views wholly at\n",
      "variance with the Virginia plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “Under favorable circumstances and to a limited extent,” he\n",
      "   said,[362] “an emission of Treasury notes would probably afford\n",
      "   relief; but Treasury notes are an expensive and precarious\n",
      "   substitute either for coin or for bank-notes, charged as they\n",
      "   are with a growing interest, productive of no countervailing\n",
      "   profit or emolument, and exposed to every breath of popular\n",
      "   prejudice or alarm. The establishment of a national institution\n",
      "   operating upon credit combined with capital, and regulated by\n",
      "   prudence and good faith, is after all the only efficient remedy\n",
      "   for the disordered condition of our circulating medium. While\n",
      "   accomplishing that object, too, there will be found under the\n",
      "   auspices of such an institution a safe depository for the public\n",
      "   treasure and a constant auxiliary to the public credit. But\n",
      "   whether the issues of a paper currency proceed from the national\n",
      "   Treasury or from a national Bank, the acceptance of the paper in\n",
      "   a course of payments and receipts must be forever optional with\n",
      "   the citizens. The extremity of that day cannot be anticipated\n",
      "   when any honest and enlightened statesman will again venture\n",
      "   upon the desperate expedient of a tender-law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a tender-law the Virginia scheme would hardly answer the\n",
      "purposes required, since the government must restrain the issue of\n",
      "paper within a limit too narrow for usefulness. Dallas did not press\n",
      "this point, but developed his own scheme, which required, like that of\n",
      "Eppes, a duplication of taxes to produce twenty-one million dollars,\n",
      "and the creation of a national Bank with a capital of fifty million\n",
      "dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either Eppes’s or Dallas’s plan might answer the immediate object\n",
      "of providing a currency, and both required the exercise of implied\n",
      "powers by Congress. Apparently Congress had only to choose, but in\n",
      "truth choice was most difficult. The House readily adopted Dallas’s\n",
      "recommendation in principle, and voted, October 24, by sixty-six to\n",
      "forty, that it was expedient to establish a national Bank; but the\n",
      "problem of establishing a specie-paying bank without specie passed\n",
      "its powers. Dallas abandoned the attempt at the outset. He proposed a\n",
      "bank of fifty millions capital, of which forty-four millions might be\n",
      "subscribed in government bonds and Treasury notes, and six millions in\n",
      "coin. The bank was at once to lend to government thirty millions,--of\n",
      "course in bank-notes,--and no one denied that an immediate suspension\n",
      "of specie payments must follow such an issue. To any bank, strong or\n",
      "weak, the old Virginia influence represented by Eppes was hostile; and\n",
      "to a bank insolvent from the start the Federalists also were opposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the bill, reported November 7, was printed, it was found to\n",
      "contain a provision authorizing the suspension of specie payments at\n",
      "the President’s discretion. The discussion began November 14, and\n",
      "every successive day revealed objections and increased the opposition.\n",
      "Calhoun complicated the subject still further by bringing forward,\n",
      "November 16, a plan of his own, requiring the capital to consist “one\n",
      "tenth in specie, and the remainder in specie or in Treasury notes to\n",
      "be hereafter issued,” and taking away all government control. Ingham\n",
      "of Pennsylvania, representing Dallas, combated Calhoun with force, but\n",
      "could not make his own measure agreeable to the House. His phrase in\n",
      "regard to the suspension of specie payments was significant. Congress,\n",
      "he said, would be to blame for “frantic enthusiasm” if it did not\n",
      "provide for the case. “It may happen, and probably will happen, that\n",
      "their specie payments cannot be continued, and what will then be\n",
      "the situation of the bank? Failing to fulfil the purposes designed,\n",
      "its credit is blighted, its operations are stopped, and its charter\n",
      "violated; and if this should take place before your Treasury notes are\n",
      "sold, the government will scarce obtain a moment’s relief.” That the\n",
      "new bank could not pay specie was obvious. The Bank of England itself\n",
      "could not pay specie, and had not attempted to do so for nearly twenty\n",
      "years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The House in committee adopted Calhoun’s amendment by a majority of\n",
      "about sixty, in spite of Ingham’s opposition; and thus substituted for\n",
      "Dallas’s scheme a large private bank, over which the government was\n",
      "to exercise no control, with a capital of fifty millions, nine tenths\n",
      "of which were to be Treasury notes. The House then discovered so many\n",
      "unforeseen difficulties, that November 25 it recommitted the bill to a\n",
      "select committee, of which Lowndes, Calhoun, Ingham, Forsyth, and two\n",
      "Federalists were members.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dallas was obliged openly to enter the lists against Calhoun, and\n",
      "wrote to the committee a letter, dated November 27,[363] sounding like\n",
      "a defiance: “The dividend on the funded debt has not been punctually\n",
      "paid; a large amount of Treasury notes has already been dishonored;\n",
      "and the hope of preventing further injury and reproach in transacting\n",
      "business with the Treasury is too visionary to afford a moment’s\n",
      "consolation.” Calhoun’s scheme, he plainly intimated, was impracticable\n",
      "and mischievous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, November 28, Lowndes brought back Calhoun’s bill to\n",
      "the House, together with Dallas’s letter, and told the House that\n",
      "the committee could come to no agreement. Upon this admission of\n",
      "helplessness, Hanson addressed the House in a speech which seemed to\n",
      "carry Federalist exultation to the extremest point. Protesting his\n",
      "anxiety to defend the country, Hanson uttered a cry of triumph over the\n",
      "destruction of the government:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   “Not only had government bills been dishonored and the interest\n",
      "   of the public debt remained unpaid, but ... so completely\n",
      "   empty was the Treasury and destitute of credit, that funds\n",
      "   could not be obtained to defray the current ordinary expenses\n",
      "   of the different Departments. Disgraceful, humiliating as the\n",
      "   fact was, it ought not to be concealed from the nation, and he\n",
      "   felt it his duty to state to the House that the Department\n",
      "   of State was so bare of money as to be unable to pay even\n",
      "   its stationery bill. The government was subsisting upon the\n",
      "   drainings of unchartered banks in the District, which felt\n",
      "   themselves compelled to contribute their means lest the rod\n",
      "   _in terrorem_ which was held over them should be applied,\n",
      "   and an Act of incorporation refused.”\n",
      "\n",
      "No one contradicted or answered Hanson. The House wavered in incapacity\n",
      "that suggested dissolution. At last Richard M. Johnson, in order to\n",
      "force a decision right or wrong, moved the previous question and\n",
      "brought the House to a vote. Then the majority turned against Calhoun,\n",
      "as they had before turned against Dallas, and rejected the bill by a\n",
      "vote of one hundred and four to forty-nine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Southern preference for government paper currency lay at the bottom\n",
      "of Calhoun’s scheme as of Jefferson’s, and seemed to Dallas to combine\n",
      "ignorance with dishonesty. Treasury notes bearing interest could not\n",
      "be made to serve as a currency, and were useless as a foundation for\n",
      "government paper. “What use is there,” asked Ingersoll,[364] “in such\n",
      "a mass of banking machinery to give circulation to some millions of\n",
      "Treasury notes? Why not issue them at once without this unwieldy, this\n",
      "unnecessary medium?” Yet when Bolling Hall of Georgia, in pursuance of\n",
      "Macon’s aphorism that “paper money never was beat,” moved, November 12,\n",
      "Resolutions authorizing the issue of Treasury notes as legal tender,\n",
      "the House refused to consider it by a vote of ninety-five to forty-two.\n",
      "Eppes did not vote; Calhoun voted against it, and of the twenty-five\n",
      "Southern members who supported it Macon and Stanford were the most\n",
      "prominent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be plainer than that the House must ultimately come to\n",
      "inconvertible government paper, whether issued by the Treasury or by\n",
      "a Bank. Dallas, Eppes, and Calhoun were all agreed on that point, if\n",
      "on no other; but after Congress had sat two months and a half, the\n",
      "House was no nearer a decision than when it met. The Federalists,\n",
      "voting at one time with Calhoun, at another with Dallas, were able to\n",
      "paralyze action. Eppes wrote to Dallas, December 2, inviting further\n",
      "information; and Dallas wrote back the same day, recounting the needs\n",
      "of the Treasury for the current month, merely on account of the\n",
      "national debt. Dallas reported that $5,726,000 in Treasury notes and\n",
      "dividends were due, or would fall due by January 1; and that including\n",
      "unavailable bank-credits, and subject to possible contingencies,\n",
      "the Treasury might contain resources to meet these demands to the\n",
      "amount of $3,972,000.[365] Eppes could do no more for immediate\n",
      "relief than report a bill for the issue of some ten millions more of\n",
      "interest-bearing Treasury notes, which was passed without debate and\n",
      "became law, December 26, without improving the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The House also passed the heavy tax-bills without much opposition\n",
      "except from Federalists who wished to stop military operations on the\n",
      "part of the government. Between thirty and forty members, or about one\n",
      "half of the Federalists, carried their opposition to that point. The\n",
      "bill raising the direct tax to six million dollars passed the House,\n",
      "December 22, by a vote of one hundred and six to fifty-three, and\n",
      "passed the Senate, January 5, 1815, by twenty-three to seven. Dallas\n",
      "and Eppes hoped to raise about twenty million dollars through the new\n",
      "taxation, or twice what had been previously attempted. Jefferson held\n",
      "that these taxes could not be paid, and expressed his opinion without\n",
      "reserve.\n",

      "   “If anything could revolt our citizens against the war,” wrote\n",

      "   for their wheat, while they pay twelve dollars a bushel for\n",
      "   their salt, pay five times the amount of taxes they ever paid\n",

      "of the law by taking the bank paper in discharge for these taxes?”\n",
      "That the bank paper was worth less than Treasury notes was shown\n",
      "by the Southern States paying their taxes in such paper, when they\n",

      "intolerable pressure by giving the means of indefinite depreciation;\n",
      "but to the government such a resource meant merely a larger variety\n",
      "of bank-credits, which were of no certain value even in the towns\n",
      "where the banks existed, and were of no value at all elsewhere. The\n",
      "burden of taxation would be thrown chiefly on New England; and if the\n",

      "WHILE Dallas struggled with Congress to obtain the means of\n",
      "establishing a currency in order to pay the army, Monroe carried on a\n",
      "similar struggle in order to obtain an army to pay. On this point, as\n",
      "on the financial issue, Virginian ideas did not accord with the wishes\n",
      "of Government. The prejudice against a regular army was stimulated\n",
      "by the evident impossibility of raising or supporting it. Once more\n",
      "Jefferson expressed the common feeling of his Virginia neighbors.[374]\n",
      "\n",
      "   “We must prepare for interminable war,” he wrote to Monroe,\n",
      "   October 16. “To this end we should put our house in order by\n",
      "   providing men and money to an indefinite extent. The former may\n",
      "   be done by classing our militia, and assigning each class to the\n",
      "   description of duties for which it is fit. It is nonsense to\n",
      "   talk of regulars. They are not to be had among a people so easy\n",
      "   and happy at home as ours. We might as well rely on calling down\n",
      "   an army of angels from heaven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Jefferson lost the habits of power and became once more a Virginia\n",
      "planter, he reverted to the opinions and prejudices of his earlier life\n",
      "and of the society in which he lived. As Monroe grew accustomed to the\n",
      "exercise and the necessities of power, he threw aside Virginian ideas\n",
      "and accepted the responsibilities of government. On the same day when\n",
      "Jefferson wrote to Monroe that it was nonsense to talk of regulars,\n",
      "Monroe wrote to Congress that it was nonsense to talk of militia. The\n",
      "divergence between Monroe and Jefferson was even greater than between\n",
      "Dallas and Eppes.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “It may be stated with confidence,” wrote Monroe to\n",
      "   Congress,[375] “that at least three times the force in militia\n",
      "   has been employed at our principal cities, along the coast and\n",
      "   on the frontier, in marching to and returning thence, that would\n",
      "   have been necessary in regular troops; and that the expense\n",
      "   attending it has been more than proportionately augmented from\n",
      "   the difficulty if not the impossibility of preserving the same\n",
      "   degree of system in the militia as in the regular service.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Monroe’s opinion a regular force was an object “of the highest\n",
      "importance.” He told the Senate committee that the army, which was only\n",
      "thirty-four thousand strong on the first of October, should be raised\n",
      "to its legal limit of sixty-two thousand, and that another permanent\n",
      "army of forty thousand men should be raised for strictly defensive\n",
      "service. In the face of Jefferson’s warning that he might as well call\n",
      "down an army of angels from heaven, Monroe called for one hundred\n",
      "thousand regular troops, when no exertions had hitherto availed to\n",
      "keep thirty thousand effectives on the rolls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mere expression of such a demand carried with it the train of\n",
      "consequences which the people chiefly dreaded. One hundred thousand\n",
      "troops could be raised only by draft. Monroe affirmed the power as well\n",
      "as the need of drafting. “Congress have a right by the Constitution,”\n",
      "he said, “to raise regular armies, and no restraint is imposed on the\n",
      "exercise of it.... It would be absurd to suppose that Congress could\n",
      "not carry this power into effect otherwise than by accepting the\n",
      "voluntary service of individuals.” Absurd as it was, such had been\n",
      "the general impression, and Monroe was believed to have been one of\n",
      "the most emphatic in maintaining it. “Ask him,” suggested Randolph,\n",
      "“what he would have done, while governor of Virginia and preparing to\n",
      "resist Federal usurpation, had such an attempt been made by Mr. Adams\n",
      "and his ministers, especially in 1800. He _can_ give the answer.”\n",
      "Doubtless the silence of the Constitution in respect to conscription\n",
      "was conclusive to some minds in favor of the power; but the people\n",
      "preferred the contrary view, the more because militia service seemed to\n",
      "give more pay for less risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chance of carrying such a measure through Congress was not\n",
      "great, yet Monroe recommended it as his first plan for raising men.\n",
      "He proposed to enroll the free male population between eighteen and\n",
      "forty-five years of age into classes of one hundred, each to furnish\n",
      "four men and to keep their places supplied.[376] The second plan\n",
      "varied from the first only in the classification, not in the absence\n",
      "of compulsion. The militia were to be divided into three sections\n",
      "according to age, with the obligation to serve, when required, for a\n",
      "term of two years. A third plan suggested the exemption from militia\n",
      "service of every five militia-men who could provide one man for\n",
      "the war. If none of these schemes should be approved by Congress,\n",
      "additional bounties must be given under the actual system. Of the four\n",
      "plans, the secretary preferred the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Senate committee immediately summoned Monroe to an interview. They\n",
      "wished an explanation of the failure in the recruiting service, and\n",
      "were told by Monroe that the failure was chiefly due to the competition\n",
      "of the detached militia for substitutes.[377] The military committee\n",
      "of the House then joined with the military committee of the Senate in\n",
      "sounding the members of both bodies in order to ascertain the most\n",
      "rigorous measure that could be passed. According to the report of Troup\n",
      "of Georgia, chairman of the House committee,[378] they “found that no\n",
      "efficacious measure, calculated certainly and promptly to fill the\n",
      "regular army, could be effectually resorted to. Measures were matured\n",
      "and proposed by the [House] committee, but were not pressed on the\n",
      "House, from the solemn conviction that there was no disposition in the\n",
      "Legislature to act finally on the subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the issue was made at a moment of extreme anxiety and almost\n",
      "despair. In October, 1814, the result of the war was believed to\n",
      "depend on the establishment of an efficient draft. The price of United\n",
      "States six-per-cents showed better than any other evidence the opinion\n",
      "of the public; but the military situation, known to all the world,\n",
      "warranted deep depression. Sir George Prevost, about to be succeeded\n",
      "by an efficient commander,--Sir George Murray,--was then at Kingston\n",
      "organizing a campaign against Sackett’s Harbor, with an army of twenty\n",
      "thousand regular troops and a fleet that controlled the Lake. Another\n",
      "great force, military and naval, was known to be on its way to New\n",
      "Orleans; and the defences of New Orleans were no stronger than those of\n",
      "Washington. One half the province of Maine, from Eastport to Castine,\n",
      "was already in British possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "To leave no doubt of England’s intentions, despatches from Ghent,\n",
      "communicating the conditions on which the British government offered\n",
      "peace, arrived from the American commissioners and were sent, October\n",
      "10, to Congress. These conditions assumed rights of conquest.\n",
      "The British negotiators demanded four territorial or proprietary\n",
      "concessions, and all were vital to the integrity of the Union. First,\n",
      "the whole Indian Territory of the Northwest, including about one third\n",
      "of the State of Ohio, two thirds of Indiana, and nearly the entire\n",
      "region from which the States of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan were\n",
      "afterward created, was to be set aside forever as Indian country under\n",
      "British guaranty. Second, the United States were to be excluded from\n",
      "military or naval contact with the Lakes. Third, they had forfeited\n",
      "their rights in the fisheries. Fourth, they were to cede a portion of\n",
      "Maine to strengthen Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "These demands, following the unparalleled insult of burning Washington,\n",
      "foreshadowed a war carried to extremities, and military preparations\n",
      "such as the Union had no means ready to repel. Monroe’s recommendations\n",
      "rested on the conviction that the nation must resort to extreme\n",
      "measures. Dallas’s financial plan could not have been suggested except\n",
      "as a desperate resource. Congress understood as well as the Executive\n",
      "the impending peril, and stood in even more fear of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under these circumstances, when Troup’s committee refused to act, Giles\n",
      "reported, on behalf of the Senate committee, two military measures.\n",
      "The first, for filling the regular army, proposed to extend the\n",
      "age of enlistment from twenty-one to eighteen years; to double the\n",
      "land-bounty; and to exempt from militia duty every militia-man who\n",
      "should furnish a recruit for the regular service.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second measure, reported the same day, November 5, purported to\n",
      "authorize the raising an army of eighty thousand militia-men by draft,\n",
      "to serve for two years within the limits of their own or an adjoining\n",
      "State.[379] The provisions of this measure were ill-conceived,\n",
      "ill-digested, and unlikely to answer their purpose. The moment the\n",
      "debate began, the bill was attacked so vigorously as to destroy\n",
      "whatever credit it might have otherwise possessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the supporters of the war, Senator Varnum of Massachusetts was\n",
      "one of the steadiest. He was also the highest authority in the Senate\n",
      "on matters pertaining to the militia. When Giles’s bill came under\n",
      "discussion November 16, Varnum began the debate by a speech vehemently\n",
      "hostile to the proposed legislation. He first objected that although\n",
      "the bill purported to call for an army of eighty thousand men, “yet in\n",
      "some of the subsequent sections of it we find that instead of realizing\n",
      "the pleasing prospect of seeing an ample force in the field, the force\n",
      "is to be reduced to an indefinite amount,--which contradiction in\n",
      "terms, inconsistency in principle, and uncertainty in effect, cannot\n",
      "fail to produce mortification and chagrin in every breast.” Varnum\n",
      "objected to drafting men from the militia for two years’ service\n",
      "because the principle of nine months’ service was already established\n",
      "by the common law. If the nation wanted a regular force, why not make\n",
      "it a part of the regular army without a system of drafting militia\n",
      "“unnecessary, unequal, and unjust?” The machinery of classification\n",
      "and draft was “wholly impracticable.” The limit of service to adjoining\n",
      "States abandoned the objects for which the Union existed. The proffered\n",
      "bounties would ruin the recruiting service for the regular army; the\n",
      "proffered exemptions and reductions in term of duty left no permanency\n",
      "to the service. The bill inflicted no penalties and charged no officers\n",
      "with the duty of making the draft. “I consider the whole system as\n",
      "resolving into a recommendation upon the patriotism of the States and\n",
      "Territories and upon the patriotism of the classes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The justice of Varnum’s criticism could not fairly be questioned. The\n",
      "bill authorized the President “to issue his orders to such officers of\n",
      "the militia as he may think proper,” and left the classification and\n",
      "draft in the hands of these militia officers. Every drafted man who had\n",
      "performed any tour of duty in the militia since the beginning of the\n",
      "war was entitled to deduct a corresponding term from his two years of\n",
      "service; and obviously the demand created for substitutes would stop\n",
      "recruiting for the regular army.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly had Varnum sat down when Senator Daggett of Connecticut spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “The bill,” said the Connecticut senator, “is incapable of being\n",
      "   executed, as well as unconstitutional and unjust. It proceeds\n",
      "   entirely upon the idea that the State governments will lend\n",
      "   their aid to carry it into effect. If they refuse, it becomes\n",
      "   inoperative. Now, sir, will the Executives, who believe it a\n",

      "were meant to express the will of the convention which was to meet\n",
      "at Hartford within a month. The sentiment thus avowed was supported\n",
      "by another New England senator, whose State was not a party to the\n",
      "Convention. Jeremiah Mason of New Hampshire was second to no one in\n",
      "legal ability or in personal authority, and when he followed Daggett\n",

      "of success in the coming year was sufficiently fair, and privateering\n",
      "promised to be more active than ever; but the army was threatened with\n",
      "many perils. The most serious of all dangers to the military service\n",
      "of the Union was supposed by Federalists to be the establishment of\n",
      "armies by the separate States. The attempt to establish such an army\n",
      "by Massachusetts in time of peace had been one of the causes which\n",
      "led to the Constitution of 1789;[399] and at the close of 1814,\n",
      "when Massachusetts voted to raise an army of ten thousand men, the\n",
      "significance of the step was more clearly evident than in the time of\n",
      "the Confederation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The State of Massachusetts might be supposed to act in a spirit of\n",
      "hostility to the Constitution; but no such motive actuated States\n",
      "outside of New England. If they followed the same course, they did\n",
      "so because the national government was believed to be incompetent to\n",
      "the general defence. Of all the States Massachusetts alone possessed\n",
      "considerable resources, and could command both credit and specie; yet\n",
      "the creation of a State army of ten thousand men overburdened her\n",
      "finances, and obliged her to claim her share of the national revenues.\n",
      "No other State could expect to support an army without immediate\n",
      "financial trouble. Yet Governor Tompkins of New York recommended to the\n",
      "legislature in September the establishment of a State army of twenty\n",
      "thousand men,[400] and the legislature passed Acts for the purpose. The\n",
      "legislature of Pennsylvania took a similar measure into consideration.\n",
      "The legislature of Maryland passed an Act for raising five thousand\n",
      "State troops. Virginia decided also to create a State army, with two\n",
      "major-generals. South Carolina passed a law for raising a brigade of\n",
      "State troops, and appointed the officers. Kentucky took measures for\n",
      "raising a State army of ten thousand men.\n",
      "\n",
      "The national government, unable to create an efficient army of its\n",
      "own, yielded to necessity, and looked already to the State armies as\n",
      "levies to be taken into the national service in case of need. The\n",
      "States, on their side, unable to bear the expense of separate armies,\n",
      "expected to be relieved of the burden by the national government. Yet\n",
      "for the moment the States, however deficient their means might be,\n",
      "seemed better able than the general government not only to raise men\n",
      "but to support them. In January, 1815, the financial resources of the\n",
      "government were exhausted, so that the Treasury could not meet the\n",
      "drafts drawn by Major-General Jackson and the pressing demands of\n",
      "the paymaster at New Orleans. The Secretary of War was obliged to go\n",
      "from bank to bank of Washington and Georgetown asking, as a personal\n",
      "favor, loans of their bank-notes already depreciated about fifty per\n",
      "cent. So desperate, according to Monroe’s account, was the situation\n",
      "that his success depended on adding his own guaranty to that of the\n",
      "government.[401] At no time of his life were Monroe’s means sufficient\n",
      "to supply his private needs, and nothing could express so strongly his\n",
      "sense of national bankruptcy as the assertion that his credit was\n",
      "required to support that of the United States.[402]\n",

      "whether Cabot was the fittest choice.[413] Lowell replied that he\n",
      "shared these doubts, and that in consequence he had been led to oppose\n",
      "the convention altogether, because it would not withdraw the State\n",

      "affairs New England offered a constant protest. Yet the Massachusetts\n",
      "delegation to Hartford was in sympathy with Cabot, while the\n",

      "In the Council Chamber of the State House at Hartford the delegates\n",
      "assembled, December 15, and gave instant evidence of their intention\n",
      "to discourage appeals to popular emotion. Their earliest steps decided\n",
      "their whole course. They chose George Cabot as their President, and\n",
      "they made their sessions secret. Under no circumstances could the\n",
      "convention have regarded itself as a popular body, for the delegates\n",
      "numbered only twenty-three persons, mostly cautious and elderly men,\n",
      "who detested democracy, but disliked enthusiasm almost as much. Two\n",
      "new members, appointed by popular meetings in New Hampshire, were\n",

      "Excess of caution helped to give the convention an air of conspiracy,\n",
      "which warned future conspirators to prefer acting, or appearing to act,\n",
      "in public. The secrecy of the Hartford conference was chiefly intended\n",
      "to secure freedom for the exchange of opinion, and also in some degree\n",
      "to prevent premature excitement and intrusion of popular feeling; but\n",
      "the secrecy created a belief that the debates would not bear publicity.\n",
      "Possibly much was said which verged on treasonable conspiracy; but\n",
      "the members were not men of a class likely to act beyond their\n",
      "instructions, and they adhered strictly to the practical task imposed\n",
      "on them. Some years afterward, Harrison Gray Otis, laboring to clear\n",
      "his political reputation from the stigma of membership, caused the\n",
      "official journal of the convention to be published; and the record,\n",
      "though revealing nothing of what was said, proved that nothing was\n",
      "formally done or proposed which contradicted the grave and restrained\n",

      "the next day the points in dispute between the States and the national\n",
      "government,--the militia power, conscription power, duty and means of\n",
      "defence, and matters of a like nature. After two days of discussion,\n",
      "the convention appointed another committee to frame a general project\n",

      "its head, with Otis second. Still another committee was appointed,\n",
      "December 21, to prepare a report showing the reasons which guided the\n",
      "convention to its results; and of that committee Otis was chairman.\n",

      "scarcely fail to reflect in some degree the character of the man as\n",
      "well as of the body for which he was acting. Though ambitious of\n",
      "leading, Otis never led. John Lowell described his character, as it\n",

      "the final report--after a discussion lasting from December 24 to\n",
      "December 30--was framed. The discussions, both in committee and in\n",
      "convention, took much time and caused some difficulties; but nothing\n",
      "was ever known of the speeches made, or of the motions proposed, or\n",
      "of the amendments offered. All the reports were finally adopted by\n",
      "the convention; and all proposed business then having been finished,\n",

      "for extreme measures, the report bore striking evidence of the popular\n",
      "passion which urged them forward. A few paragraphs in its first pages\n",

      "with equal zeal in the same sense. The governor, John Cotton Smith, was\n",
      "an old man, and neither his opinions nor his passions were extreme; but\n",
      "as far as concerned the Hartford Convention, his views differed little\n",
      "from those of Pickering and Lowell. He called a special session of the\n",
      "legislature for January 25, to act on the delegates’ report; and his\n",
      "speech at the opening of the session would have been taken for irony,\n",
      "had his moderation of character not been known.[427] “The temperate and\n",
      "magnanimous course proposed for our adoption cannot fail to allay the\n",
      "apprehensions which many have professed to entertain, and to enliven\n",
      "the hopes of all who cherish our national Union, and are disposed to\n",
      "place it on a solid and durable basis.” The legislature without delay\n",
      "approved the measures recommended by the convention, and appointed\n",
      "delegates to accompany those sent from Massachusetts to effect the\n",
      "proposed arrangement with the government at Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "In later times the Hartford Convention was often and vigorously\n",
      "defended by writers whose works were friendly to the national\n",
      "government, and whose influence was popular.[428] The wisdom, loyalty,\n",
      "and patriotism of George Cabot and his associates became the theme\n",
      "of authors whose authority was above dispute. Nearly always the\n",
      "defence rested on the argument that popular opinion went beyond the\n",
      "convention’s report, and that the convention risked its credit by\n",
      "refusing to advise instant withdrawal from the Union.[429] This view\n",
      "was apparently correct. The efforts of the moderate Federalists to\n",
      "praise the moderation of the report, and the labored protests of the\n",
      "extremists against the possible suspicion that they objected to its\n",
      "moderation,[430] showed that the convention was then believed to have\n",
      "offered resistance to what Governor Smith stigmatized as “rash councils\n",
      "or precipitate measures.” The tone of the press and the elections bore\n",
      "out the belief that a popular majority would have supported an abrupt\n",
      "and violent course.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tone of the minority at the time showed a similar belief that\n",
      "Massachusetts favored disunion. During all the proceedings of the State\n",
      "legislatures and the convention, the loyal press and citizens never\n",
      "ceased to point out the dangerous, treasonable, and absurd results to\n",
      "be expected from the course pursued. In the Massachusetts Senate John\n",
      "Holmes of Maine attacked the convention and its doings in a speech\n",
      "that gave him wide reputation.[431] Threats of civil war were freely\n",
      "uttered and defied. Among the least violent of Federalists was James\n",
      "Lloyd, recently United States senator from Massachusetts; and to him\n",
      "as a man of known patriotism John Randolph addressed a letter, Dec.\n",
      "15, 1814, remonstrating against the Hartford Convention that day to\n",
      "meet. Lloyd replied in a letter also published, advising Randolph and\n",
      "the Virginians to coerce Madison into retirement, and to place Rufus\n",
      "King in the Presidency as the alternative to a fatal issue.[432] The\n",
      "assertion of such an alternative showed how desperate the situation was\n",
      "believed by the moderate Federalists to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "A long letter of a similar kind was written, Nov. 26, 1814, by Jonathan\n",
      "Mason to Wilson Cary Nicholas.[433] The opinion of the men among whom\n",
      "Mason lived was expressly declared by Mason to the effect that “Great\n",
      "Britain will not treat with Mr. Madison. He must retire, or the country\n",
      "and the Union are at an end.... This is plain language, but in my soul\n",
      "I believe it true. We shall not be destroyed to-day or to-morrow, but\n",
      "it will come; and the end of these measures [of the Administration]\n",
      "will be disunion and disgrace.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Republican party the belief was universal that the Hartford\n",
      "Convention could lead only to a New England Confederation; and the\n",
      "belief was not confined to partisans. An anecdote that George Ticknor\n",
      "delighted in telling, illustrated the emotion that then agitated men\n",
      "far beyond the passing and fitful excitements of party politics.\n",
      "Ticknor, a young Federalist twenty-three years old, wished for letters\n",
      "of introduction to Virginia, and asked them from John Adams, then a man\n",
      "of eighty, whose support of the war made him an object of antipathy to\n",
      "the party he had led.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “When I visited him in Quincy to receive these letters,” related\n",
      "   Ticknor,[434] “I had a remarkable interview with him, which at\n",
      "   the time disturbed me not a little.... Soon after I was seated\n",
      "   in Mr. Adams’s parlor,--where was no one but himself and Mrs.\n",
      "   Adams, who was knitting,--he began to talk of the condition of\n",
      "   the country with great earnestness. I said not a word; Mrs.\n",
      "   Adams was equally silent; but Mr. Adams, who was a man of strong\n",
      "   and prompt passions, went on more and more vehemently. He was\n",
      "   dressed in a single-breasted dark-green coat, buttoned tightly\n",
      "   by very large white metal buttons over his somewhat rotund\n",
      "   person. As he grew more and more excited in his discourse,\n",
      "   he impatiently endeavored to thrust his hand into the breast\n",
      "   of his coat. The buttons did not yield readily; at last he\n",
      "   _forced_ his hand in, saying, as he did so, in a very loud\n",
      "   voice and most excited manner: ‘Thank God! thank God! George\n",
      "   Cabot’s close-buttoned ambition has broke out at last: he wants\n",
      "   to be President of New England, sir!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether George Cabot wanted it or not, he was in danger of becoming\n",
      "what John Adams predicted. He was far from being the first man who had\n",
      "unwillingly allowed himself to be drawn into a position from which\n",
      "escape was impossible. After going so far, neither leaders nor people\n",
      "could retreat. The next and easy step of sequestrating the direct and\n",
      "indirect taxes was one to which the State stood pledged in the event of\n",
      "a refusal by President Madison and Congress to surrender them. After\n",
      "such an act, the establishment of a New England Confederation could\n",
      "hardly be matter of choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "If so considerable a mass of concurrent testimony did not prove the\n",
      "gravity of the occasion, as it was understood by the most intelligent\n",
      "and best-informed men of the time, ample evidence could be drawn from\n",
      "other sources. William Wirt described the painful anxiety of Madison\n",
      "as early as the month of October. Throughout Virginia the depression\n",
      "was akin to despair. John Randolph and Wilson Cary Nicholas gave\n",
      "expression to it in letters to prominent New Englanders; but Jefferson\n",
      "in private was still more pronounced in his fears. “The war, had it\n",
      "proceeded, would have upset our government,” he wrote to Gallatin a\n",
      "year later,[435] “and a new one, whenever tried, will do it.” George\n",
      "Ticknor, after obtaining at Quincy his letter of introduction from\n",
      "John Adams to Jefferson, delivered it at Monticello at a time when the\n",
      "anxiety for the safety of New Orleans was acute. He found Jefferson\n",
      "convinced that the city must fall, and Jefferson expressed the\n",
      "expectation that the British would hold it indefinitely.[436] Pickering\n",
      "felt the same conviction, and regarded the event as a dissolution of\n",
      "the Union.\n",

      "to resign; and there must be peace by that or a future Administration.”\n",
      "The fall of New Orleans was to be the signal for a general demand that\n",
      "Madison should resign, and the Federalist press already prepared the\n",
      "ground by insisting that “Mr. Madison has scarcely raised his little\n",
      "finger to preserve New Orleans,” and would finally determine to abandon\n",

      "A DESPATCH from Lord Bathurst, marked “most secret,” and dated\n",
      "July 30, 1814, informed Major-General Ross that, after finishing his\n",
      "operations in Chesapeake Bay, he was to sail with his whole force to\n",
      "Jamaica, where he would join an expedition then preparing in England\n",
      "to rendezvous at Cape Negril on the west coast of Jamaica about\n",
      "November 20. Lieutenant-General Lord Hill was to command the combined\n",
      "land-forces.[438] These orders were given before the arrival of a long\n",
      "report from Vice-Admiral Cochrane concerning the military condition\n",
      "of the American territories on the Gulf of Mexico, which Cochrane\n",
      "considered such “that he had no doubt in his mind that three thousand\n",
      "British troops landed at Mobile, where they would be joined by all the\n",
      "Indians, with the disaffected French and Spaniards, would drive the\n",
      "Americans entirely out of Louisiana and the Floridas.”[439]\n",
      "\n",
      "Circumstances induced the British government to defer sending Lord\n",
      "Hill, with a large force, to the Gulf; and Cochrane was informed by\n",
      "a despatch, dated August 10, that Major-General Ross was directed to\n",
      "carry out the Vice-Admiral’s plans, which required fewer men.[440]\n",
      "Orders were sent to Ross, of the same date, informing him that\n",
      "reinforcements amounting to more than twenty-one hundred rank-and-file\n",
      "were preparing to sail from England, which with the Fifth West India\n",
      "regiment and two hundred black pioneers from Jamaica would enable Ross\n",
      "to carry more than five thousand effective rank-and-file to the theatre\n",
      "of his operations.[441]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ross’s detailed instructions were dated September 6.[442] They began\n",
      "by recounting the force which was intended to act against New Orleans.\n",
      "The brigade from the Gironde which Ross took to the Chesapeake was\n",
      "estimated at about twenty-three hundred effectives, and a battalion\n",
      "which he had taken from Bermuda was supposed to have raised his\n",
      "rank-and-file to thirty-four hundred men. In addition to this force,\n",
      "a brigade under Major-General Keane, numbering twenty-one hundred and\n",
      "fifty men, was under orders for Jamaica, which with the black troops\n",
      "would enable Ross to proceed to his destination “with near six thousand\n",
      "men, exclusive of the marines and seamen.... About the same time you\n",
      "will be joined by the First West India regiment from Guadeloupe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The objects which rendered the success of the expedition “extremely\n",
      "important” were two: first, the command of the mouth of the\n",
      "Mississippi, so as to deprive the back settlements of America of their\n",
      "communication with the sea; second, “to occupy some important and\n",
      "valuable possession by the restoration of which we may improve the\n",
      "conditions of peace, or which may entitle us to exact its cession as\n",
      "the price of peace.”\n",

      "The point of attack was left to the discretion of Cochrane and Ross.\n",
      "They might proceed directly against New Orleans, or move in the\n",
      "first instance into the back parts of Georgia and the country of the\n",
      "friendly Indians. In either case, the second object in view could not\n",
      "be attained against the will of the inhabitants. “With their favor and\n",
      "co-operation, on the other hand, we may expect to rescue the whole\n",
      "province of Louisiana from the United States.”\n",

      "   “If therefore you shall find in the inhabitants a general and\n",
      "   decided disposition to withdraw from their recent connection\n",
      "   with the United States, either with the view of establishing\n",
      "   themselves as an independent people or of returning under the\n",
      "   dominion of the Spanish Crown, you will give them every support\n",
      "   in your power; you will furnish them with arms and clothing, and\n",

      "   which will be best evinced by their committing themselves in\n",
      "   some act of decided hostility against the United States....\n",
      "   You will discountenance any proposition of the inhabitants to\n",
      "   place themselves under the dominion of Great Britain; and\n",
      "   you will direct their disposition toward returning under the\n",
      "   protection of the Spanish Crown rather than to the attempting\n",

      "Ross’s report of the capture of Washington reached Lord Bathurst\n",
      "September 27, and caused so much satisfaction that the British\n",

      "major-general, Lambert, with a brigade numbering twenty-two hundred\n",
      "rank-and-file, under Ross’s command, to be used without restriction,\n",
      "either in the Middle or the Southern States.[443] The Prince Regent\n",
      "highly applauded the ability with which Ross had conducted the capture\n",
      "of Washington, “an enterprise so creditable to his Majesty’s arms,\n",
      "and so well calculated to humble the presumption of the American\n",
      "government, which contrary to the real interests, and as it is believed\n",
      "contrary to the prevailing wish, of the nation has involved that\n",
      "country in an unnecessary and unjust war against his Majesty.”[444]\n",
      "Only in one respect did Bathurst hint a criticism on the course pursued\n",
      "by Ross. While informing him, September 29, that reinforcements were\n",
      "on their way which would place upward of ten thousand men under his\n",
      "command, to be used very much at his discretion, Bathurst added,[445]--\n",

      "   “You and your troops have gained great credit in the discipline\n",
      "   you observed at Washington. It is no disparagement of your\n",
      "   merit to say that it was prudent as well as merciful to show\n",
      "   such forbearance. If, however, you should attack Baltimore, and\n",
      "   could, consistent with that discipline _which it is essential\n",

      "selected a new commander for the expedition to New Orleans. Orders,\n",
      "dated October 24, were sent to Major-Generals Sir Edward Pakenham and\n",
      "Gibbs to join Vice-Admiral Cochrane forthwith, detailing the force at\n",
      "their command. Pakenham was to follow the instructions already given\n",

      "Orleans was already fixed for November 20, and Pakenham could at that\n",

      "Military District No. 7, in which New Orleans and Mobile were\n",
      "situated, had not been neglected by the United States government.\n",
      "The regular force assigned by Secretary Armstrong for its defence\n",
      "consisted of five regiments of United States Infantry,--the Second,\n",
      "Third, Seventh, Thirty-ninth, and Forty-fourth, with three hundred\n",
      "and fifty artillerists,--an aggregate of two thousand three hundred\n",
      "and seventy-eight men. The provision was relatively liberal. District\n",
      "No. 5, on Chesapeake Bay, contained an aggregate of two thousand two\n",
      "hundred and eight regular troops; District No. 6, including North and\n",
      "South Carolina and Georgia, was allotted two thousand two hundred and\n",
      "forty-four men. One half the regular army was employed in such garrison\n",
      "duty, and a greater number could not have been allotted consistently\n",
      "with retaining an army in the field. Indeed, the only means by which\n",
      "Armstrong could provide so strong a defence, aggregating nearly eight\n",
      "thousand men, for the Southern States was by stripping Massachusetts.\n",
      "District No. 1, including Massachusetts and Maine, contained only\n",
      "six hundred and fifty-five regular troops; and District No. 2,\n",
      "including Rhode Island and Connecticut, contained only seven hundred\n",
      "and fourteen. Besides the regular troops, New Orleans enjoyed the\n",
      "protection of gunboats and one or two larger armed vessels. The city\n",
      "needed only an efficient commander to defy any ordinary attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Armstrong supplied a commander who might, as he believed, be safely\n",
      "considered efficient. In the month of May Andrew Jackson was appointed\n",
      "to the command of Military District No. 7, with headquarters at\n",
      "Mobile. At that moment Jackson, having finished the Creek war, was\n",
      "about to make the necessary arrangements for the future control of the\n",
      "Creek nation, and he did not take immediate command of his district.\n",
      "No occasion for haste existed. During the summer of 1814 no British\n",
      "force of consequence approached the Gulf of Mexico, or was likely to\n",
      "approach it until the frosts began. Jackson was detained in the centre\n",
      "of Alabama, undisturbed by fears for New Orleans, until the so-called\n",
      "Treaty or Capitulation of August 9 with the Creeks released him from\n",
      "further duties in that region. He left the Creek country August 11,\n",
      "with his regular troops, going by water down the Alabama River, and\n",
      "arriving at Mobile about August 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment government was brought to a stand-still at\n",
      "Washington by the appearance of General Ross’s army in the Patuxent,\n",
      "and the raids on Washington and Baltimore. Between August 20 and\n",
      "September 25 the War Department could do little more than attend to\n",
      "its own pressing dangers. Jackson was left independent, substantially\n",
      "dictator over the Southwest. If New England carried out its intentions,\n",
      "and the government sank, as seemed probable, into helplessness, his\n",
      "dictatorship was likely to be permanent.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jackson arrived at Mobile, August 15, the defence of New Orleans\n",
      "was not in his mind. The people of Tennessee and Georgia had long\n",
      "been bent on the seizure of the Floridas, and Jackson had been one of\n",
      "the most ardent in favoring the step. The Creek war and the escape of\n",
      "the hostile Creeks to East Florida strengthened his conviction that\n",
      "the Spaniards must be expelled. He had begun the war with the idea\n",
      "of pushing his army directly through the Creek country to Pensacola,\n",

      "sloop-of-war, the “Sophie,” appeared at Barataria, forty miles\n",
      "south of New Orleans. There for several years smugglers and pirates\n",

      "The British force at Pensacola consisted chiefly of four sloops,\n",
      "commanded by Captain W. H. Percy,--the “Hermes,” twenty-two guns, the\n",
      "“Carron,” twenty, and the “Sophie” and “Childers” of eighteen guns\n",
      "each. The usual armament of such vessels consisted of thirty-two-pound\n",
      "carronades, with two long-nines or sixes. Apparently the British\n",
      "squadron threw thirty-four thirty-two-pound shot, and four nine\n",
      "or six pound balls at a broadside. Whether the armament was greater\n",
      "or smaller mattered little, for Captain Percy was unable to use with\n",
      "effect the batteries of either the “Carron” or the “Childers.” With\n",
      "much difficulty, owing to the shoals, he brought his squadron within\n",
      "range of Fort Bowyer, and with more gallantry than discretion prepared\n",
      "for the attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the British account, the land force at Percy’s command\n",
      "consisted of sixty marines and one hundred and twenty Indians, with\n",
      "one five-and-a-half-inch howitzer. According to the American account,\n",
      "a twelve-pound field-piece was placed ashore in battery with the\n",
      "howitzer. Such a force was insufficient to do more than intercept the\n",
      "garrison if it should be driven out of the fort. The brunt of the\n",
      "action fell on the ships, and experience did not warrant Percy in\n",
      "believing that his sloops, with their carronades, could silence a work\n",
      "like Fort Bowyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless Percy gallantly made the attempt. At half-past four of\n",
      "the afternoon of September 15, he brought the “Hermes” close in, and\n",
      "opened fire within musket-shot of the fort. The “Sophie” came to anchor\n",
      "some distance astern, but within range. The “Carron” and the “Childers”\n",
      "anchored so far out that their carronades were useless, and apparently\n",
      "even the American twenty-four-pounders did not touch them. The “Hermes”\n",
      "and the “Sophie” alone sustained injury,[457] but their experience was\n",
      "decisive. After an hour’s action, the cable of the “Hermes” being\n",
      "cut, she became unmanageable, and at last grounded and was abandoned.\n",
      "Captain Percy set her on fire, and carried his crew, including the\n",
      "wounded, with much difficulty to his other vessels. The “Sophie”\n",
      "withdrew from fire, and the squadron returned at once to Pensacola.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming that Captain Percy could use with effect only the twenty guns\n",
      "of the broadsides of the “Hermes” and “Sophie” against the twenty\n",
      "guns of the fort, the American gunnery was evidently superior to the\n",
      "British. The “Hermes” lost twenty-five men killed and twenty-four\n",
      "wounded,--a very severe loss in a crew which could not much have\n",
      "exceeded one hundred and fifty men. A better test of marksmanship was\n",
      "offered by the “Sophie,” which received comparatively little attention\n",
      "from the fort, but lost six killed and sixteen wounded. The whole\n",
      "American loss was reported as four killed and five wounded,[458] under\n",
      "the combined fire of both ships at close range, the fort having no\n",
      "casemates, and parapets only on the front and flanks.[459] Three guns\n",
      "were dismounted.\n",

      "Greatly pleased by this success, Jackson issued a\n",

      "not by steamer but by the ordinary flatboat.[467] Even then the arms\n",
      "were in advance of the men. The governor of Tennessee could not appoint\n",
      "an earlier day than November 13 for mustering the new levies, and on\n",
      "that day three thousand men assembled at Nashville, while two thousand\n",

      "At New Orleans nothing had yet been done for defence; but inaction\n",

      "distrustful.[484] The legislature showed incompetence and, as\n",
      "Jackson believed, indifference. The whole population of Louisiana\n",
      "was but small, containing certainly not more than fifty thousand\n",
      "white inhabitants; while the city of New Orleans probably numbered\n",
      "hardly more than twenty thousand persons including slaves. The State\n",
      "government supplied one thousand militia under the general requisition\n",
      "of the President.[485] The city raised a battalion of volunteers nearly\n",
      "three hundred strong, a rifle company numbering sixty-two men when in\n",
      "the field, and a battalion of free mulattoes, chiefly refugees from St.\n",
      "Domingo, which produced two hundred and ten men,--in all, between five\n",
      "and six hundred troops. Jackson immediately reviewed the companies,\n",
      "December 2, and could expect no further aid from these sources. No arms\n",
      "were in store, even if men could be found, and none of the necessary\n",
      "supplies of an army had been provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson’s first act after arriving at New Orleans showed no\n",
      "consciousness of danger. Armstrong, criticising his measures, afterward\n",

      "history, he would not have suffered a single day of the twenty he had\n",
      "for preparation to have passed without forming one or more intrenched\n",
      "camps for the protection of the city.” Instead of doing this, Jackson\n",
      "did what had been done by Armstrong and Winder at Washington in\n",
      "August. Having arrived in the city December 2, he started two days\n",
      "afterward to inspect Fort St. Philip on the river sixty miles below. He\n",
      "returned to New Orleans December 11,[487] believing that the British\n",
      "would approach by the river, and prepared works to arrest their\n",
      "advance.[488] He then rode out to Chef Menteur and Lake Pontchartrain\n",
      "on the north, which he thought the next probable point of attack. He\n",
      "was still absent, December 15, examining the situation of different\n",

      "first blow.[489]\n",

      "observation rather than for resistance,--although for observation a few\n",
      "fishermen’s boats would have been more useful. The British expedition,\n",
      "upward of fifty sail, made land December 10,[490] and was seen by the\n",

      "expresses to Coffee at Baton Rouge, and to Carroll and Thomas, wherever\n",
      "they might be found on the river, urging them to hasten with all\n",

      "not unanimous,[494] and at the same time he recommended the legislature\n",
      "to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. Finding the legislature hesitate,\n",
      "Jackson declared martial law by proclamation[495] the same day,\n",

      "\n",
      "THE defence of New Orleans resembled the defence of Washington\n",
      "until the moment when in each case the British expedition came within\n",
      "sight. Jackson was even slower than Winder to see the point of danger\n",
      "or to concentrate his forces. At Washington, Winder took command July\n",
      "1, and the British expedition arrived August 16; at Mobile, Jackson\n",
      "took command August 16, and the British expedition arrived December\n",
      "14. In neither case was the interval seriously employed for defence.\n",
      "So much was Jackson misled that he collected no troops, and made no\n",
      "inquiry as to the military means at his disposal at New Orleans. Had\n",
      "he gone there September 1, he would have felt the want of arms and\n",
      "equipment, and would have been able to supply them. During the summer,\n",
      "while yet among the Creeks, he was said to have made requisition for\n",
      "a quantity of war material to be sent to New Orleans;[502] but he\n",
      "certainly showed no interest in its shipment or the causes for its\n",
      "delay in arrival. The arms should have reached New Orleans in October,\n",
      "when he would have had ample time to correct any failure or want\n",
      "of supply. He could have used, in case of necessity, the steamboat\n",
      "“Enterprise,” which was then regularly plying on the Mississippi, and\n",
      "was not the only steamboat on those waters.[503] If New Orleans was\n",
      "deficient in many articles of military necessity, the fault was not\n",
      "wholly in the War Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar criticism applied to the political situation at New Orleans.\n",
      "Governor Claiborne wanted authority to control the factions in his\n",
      "legislature, and the legislature wanted an impulse sufficiently\n",
      "energetic to overcome its inertia. Probably Jackson’s presence would\n",
      "at any time have given authority to Claiborne and energy to the entire\n",
      "State government. From the moment of his actual arrival, difficulties\n",
      "of this kind seemed to cease. “It is hardly possible,” said the\n",
      "military historian of the campaign,[504] “to form an idea of the change\n",
      "which his arrival produced on the minds of the people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the British expedition was once known to have appeared at the\n",
      "entrance of Lake Borgne, Jackson’s task was perhaps simpler than\n",
      "Winder’s, for Winder might doubt whether the British meant to attack\n",
      "Washington, and in fact General Ross took the decision only at the\n",
      "last moment; but no one could doubt that New Orleans was the object\n",
      "of Pakenham’s expedition. Jackson had only to choose his positions\n",
      "and collect his resources. These were small; but on the other hand\n",
      "the British were opposed by natural difficulties much greater at\n",
      "New Orleans than at Washington. Even their greater numbers were\n",
      "a disadvantage when they were obliged to move in widely separated\n",
      "detachments, in open boats, from a point far distant from their\n",
      "column’s head, and toward a point easily fortified.\n",
      "\n",
      "If until the moment of the enemy’s appearance Jackson showed no more\n",
      "military capacity than was shown by Winder, his conduct thenceforward\n",
      "offered a contrast the more striking because it proved how Washington\n",
      "might have been saved. Winder lost his head when he saw an enemy.\n",
      "Jackson needed to see his enemy in order to act; he thought rightly\n",
      "only at the moment when he struck. At noon, December 23, New Orleans\n",
      "was in greater danger than Washington on the afternoon of August 23,\n",
      "when the British advanced from the Patuxent. Had Colonel Thornton\n",
      "followed his impulses and marched directly on the city, he must have\n",
      "reached it before a gun could have been fired by the Americans; his own\n",
      "muskets would have given the first news of his arrival. Major-General\n",
      "Keane, his commanding officer, preferred caution,[505] and his delay\n",
      "gave a few hours time for Jackson to show his qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "News that a British column had reached the Villeré plantation was\n",
      "brought to Jackson at headquarters in New Orleans, at about half-past\n",
      "one o’clock, much as the news was brought to Winder, August 24, that\n",
      "the British were marching on Bladensburg. The distances were about\n",
      "the same. Winder and Jackson both allowed the enemy to approach within\n",
      "seven miles before anything had been done for defence. In one respect\n",
      "Jackson was more unfortunate than Winder, for his troops were not\n",
      "ready to march; they were not even collected. Jackson sent orders to\n",
      "the different corps, but several hours passed before the men could be\n",
      "brought down and posted between the city and the British.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately Major Latour, chief-engineer in Military District No.\n",
      "7, had been sent that morning to examine the approaches from Lake\n",
      "Borgne, and as he rode down the road at noon he met persons flying\n",
      "toward town with news that the British had penetrated through the\n",
      "canal to Villeré’s house. Latour was a trained French engineer, whose\n",
      "services were extremely valuable, not only during the campaign but\n",
      "afterward; for he subsequently wrote a “History of the War in West\n",
      "Florida and Louisiana,” which was far the best military work published\n",
      "in the United States till long after that time, and furnished the\n",
      "only accurate maps and documents of the campaign at New Orleans.[506]\n",
      "On the morning of December 23 Latour approached within rifle-shot of\n",
      "the British force, and judged their number accurately as sixteen or\n",
      "eighteen hundred men.[507] Such exact information, which could not have\n",
      "been gained from any ordinary scout, was invaluable. Latour hastened\n",
      "to headquarters, and reported at two o’clock to Jackson the position\n",
      "and numbers of the enemy. The general, on that information, decided to\n",
      "attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "For such a purpose Jackson’s resources were ample. Four miles above the\n",
      "city his Tennessee militia were camped,--Carroll’s brigade numbering\n",
      "probably about two thousand effectives, and the remnants of Coffee’s\n",
      "mounted brigade numbering some seven hundred men in the field. The\n",
      "Mississippi and New Orleans volunteers could be reckoned at about\n",
      "seven hundred men,[508] besides three regiments of city militia. The\n",
      "Seventh United States Infantry produced four hundred and sixty-five men\n",
      "in the ranks; the Forty-fourth counted three hundred and thirty-one;\n",
      "while a detachment of artillerists, twenty-two in number, with two\n",
      "six-pound field-pieces, added greatly to the numerical strength of the\n",
      "Infantry.[509] Against Thornton’s force, numbering one thousand six\n",
      "hundred and eighty-eight rank-and-file, or about nineteen hundred men\n",
      "all told, Jackson could oppose about five thousand Infantry with two\n",
      "field-pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides these land forces Jackson was provided with another resource.\n",
      "In the river at New Orleans lay a war-schooner, the “Carolina,”\n",
      "rated at fourteen guns, armed with one long twelve-pounder and\n",
      "six twelve-pound carronades on a broadside.[510] A sixteen-gun\n",
      "sloop-of-war, the “Louisiana,” was also at New Orleans, but not\n",
      "ready for immediate use. The “Carolina” could be brought instantly\n",
      "into action, and her broadside of seven twelve-pounders, added to the\n",
      "field-battery of two six-pounders, gave Jackson immense advantage\n",
      "over the British, who had no artillery except two three-pounders and\n",
      "rockets, and whose lines must be enfiladed by the “Carolina’s” fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson, aware of his superiority, expected with reason to destroy the\n",
      "British detachment. He did not even think more than half his force\n",
      "necessary for the purpose, but detached the whole of Carroll’s brigade\n",
      "and the three regiments of city militia,--fully twenty-five hundred\n",
      "men,--to guard the town against an apprehended attack from the north.\n",
      "Without giving the reasons which led him to believe that the British\n",
      "could approach on that side without ample warning, his report said,--\n",

      "was driven back and lost ground, until the two field-pieces were in\n",
      "danger, and were hastily withdrawn.[516] Each party claimed that the\n",

      "soldiers, collecting about any officer in their neighborhood, made head\n",
      "as they best could against Coffee’s riflemen, and the whole British\n",
      "position seemed encircled by the American fire. Forced back toward\n",
      "the river, the British rallied behind an old levee which happened at\n",

      "three hundred yards.[519] Knots of men, mixed in great disorder, here\n",
      "advancing, there retreating, carried on a desultory battle over the\n",
      "field, often fighting with clubbed weapons, knives, and fists. At last\n",
      "the British centre, finding a strong protection in the old levee which\n",
      "answered for an earthwork, held firm against Coffee’s further advance,\n",

      "the “Carolina’s” guns. At about the same time several companies of the\n",
      "Twenty-first and Ninety-third regiments arrived from Lake Borgne, and\n",
      "raised the British force to two thousand and fifty rank-and-file.[520]\n",

      "and his force ceased firing before nine. Coffee withdrew his men\n",
      "at about half-past nine. The hope of destroying the British force\n",
      "was disappointed; and brilliant as the affair was, its moral effect\n",
      "was greater than the material injury it inflicted. Major-General\n",
      "Keane officially reported his loss as forty-six killed, one hundred\n",
      "and sixty-seven wounded, and sixty-four missing,--two hundred and\n",

      "and thirteen in all. The two regular regiments suffered most, losing\n",
      "fifteen killed and fifty-four wounded. Coffee’s Tennesseeans lost nine\n",

      "wounded, while Keane reported one hundred and sixty-seven. The total\n",
      "British loss at Lundy’s Lane was eight hundred and seventy-eight men;\n",
      "that of December 23 was two hundred and sixty-seven. Jackson’s battle\n",
      "was comparatively short, lasting an hour and a half, while the fighting\n",
      "at Lundy’s Lane continued some five hours. Lundy’s Lane checked the\n",

      "be expected to do more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conscious that the British army would advance as soon as its main body\n",
      "arrived, Jackson, like Brown, hastened to place his men under cover of\n",
      "works. Falling back the next morning about two miles, he took position\n",
      "behind an old canal or ditch which crossed the strip of cultivated\n",
      "ground where it was narrowest. The canal offered no serious obstacle to\n",
      "an enemy, for although ten feet wide it was shallow and dry, and fully\n",
      "three quarters of a mile long. Had the British been able to advance in\n",
      "force at any time the next day, December 24, directing their attack\n",
      "toward the skirts of the swamp to avoid the “Carolina’s” fire, they\n",
      "might have forced Jackson back upon New Orleans; but they were in no\n",
      "disposition to do on the 24th what they had not ventured to do on the\n",
      "23d, when they possessed every advantage. Keane believed that Jackson’s\n",
      "force in the night battle amounted to five thousand men.[524] Keane’s\n",
      "troops, weary, cold, without food, and exposed to the “Carolina’s”\n",
      "fire, which imprisoned them all day between the two levees,[525] were\n",
      "glad to escape further attack, and entertained no idea of advance. The\n",
      "day and night of December 24 were occupied by the British in hurrying\n",
      "the main body of their troops from the Isle aux Poix across Lake Borgne\n",
      "to the Bayou Bienvenu.\n",
      "\n",
      "By very great efforts the boats of the fleet transported the whole\n",

      "all were concentrated at the Villeré plantation. With them arrived\n",
      "Major-General Sir Edward Pakenham, and took command. Hitherto the\n",
      "frequent British disasters at Plattsburg, Sackett’s Harbor, Fort Erie,\n",
      "and the Moravian towns had been attributed to their generals. Sir\n",
      "George Prevost, Major-Generals Drummond and Riall, and Major-General\n",
      "Proctor were not officers of Wellington’s army. The British government,\n",
      "in appointing Sir Edward Pakenham to command at New Orleans, meant\n",
      "to send the ablest officer at their disposal. Pakenham was not only\n",
      "one of Wellington’s best generals, but stood in the close relation\n",
      "of his brother-in-law, Pakenham’s sister being Wellington’s wife. In\n",
      "every military respect Sir Edward Pakenham might consider himself the\n",
      "superior of Andrew Jackson. He was in the prime of life and strength,\n",
      "thirty-eight years of age, while Jackson, nearly ten years older, was\n",
      "broken in health and weak in strength. Pakenham had learned the art of\n",
      "war from Wellington, in the best school in Europe. He was supported by\n",
      "an efficient staff and a military system as perfect as experience and\n",
      "expenditure could make it, and he commanded as fine an army as England\n",
      "could produce, consisting largely of Peninsula veterans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their precise number, according to British authority, was five\n",
      "thousand and forty rank-and-file, on Christmas Day, when Pakenham\n",
      "took command.[526] Afterward many more arrived, until January 6, when\n",
      "ten regiments were in camp at Villeré’s plantation,--Royal Artillery;\n",
      "Fourteenth Light Dragoons; Fourth, Seventh, Twenty-first, Forty-third,\n",
      "Forty-fourth, Eighty-fifth, Ninety-third, and Ninety-fifth\n",
      "Infantry,--numbering, with sappers and miners and staff-corps, five\n",
      "thousand nine hundred and thirteen rank-and-file; or with a moderate\n",
      "allowance of officers, an aggregate of at least sixty-five hundred\n",
      "Europeans. Two West India regiments of black troops accompanied the\n",
      "expedition, numbering ten hundred and forty-three rank-and-file.\n",
      "The navy provided about twelve hundred marines and seamen, perhaps\n",
      "the most efficient corps in the whole body. Deducting eight hundred\n",
      "men for camp-duty, Pakenham, according to British official reports,\n",
      "could put in the field a force of eight thousand disciplined troops,\n",
      "well-officered, well-equipped, and confident both in themselves and in\n",
      "their commander. More were on their way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Duke of Wellington believed such a force fully competent to\n",
      "capture New Orleans, or to rout any American army he ever heard of;\n",
      "and his confidence would have been, if possible, still stronger, had\n",
      "he known his opponent’s resources, which were no greater and not very\n",
      "much better than those so easily overcome by Ross at Bladensburg. The\n",
      "principal difference was that Jackson commanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson’s difficulties were very great, and were overcome only by the\n",
      "desperate energy which he infused even into the volatile creoles and\n",
      "sluggish negroes. When he retired from the field of the night battle,\n",
      "he withdrew, as has been told, only two miles. About five miles below\n",
      "New Orleans he halted his troops. Between the river and the swamp,\n",
      "the strip of open and cultivated land was there somewhat narrower than\n",
      "elsewhere. A space of a thousand yards, or about three fifths of a\n",
      "mile, alone required strong defence. A shallow, dry canal, or ditch,\n",
      "ten feet wide, crossed the plain and opened into the river on one\n",
      "side and the swamp on the other. All day the troops, with the negroes\n",
      "of the neighborhood, worked, deepening the canal, and throwing up a\n",
      "parapet behind it. The two six-pound field-pieces commanded the road\n",
      "on the river-bank, and the “Louisiana” descended the river to a point\n",
      "about two miles below Jackson’s line. A mile below the “Louisiana” the\n",
      "“Carolina” remained in her old position, opposite the British camp.\n",
      "By night-fall the new lines were already formidable, and afforded\n",
      "complete protection from musketry. For further security the parapet\n",
      "was continued five hundred yards, and turned well on the flank in the\n",
      "swamp; but this task was not undertaken until December 28.[527]\n",
      "\n",
      "The first act of Sir Edward Pakenham gave the Americans at least three\n",
      "days for preparation. Even veteran soldiers, who were accustomed to\n",
      "storming mountain fortresses held by French armies, were annoyed at\n",
      "exposing their flank to the fire of fifteen or twenty heavy guns,\n",
      "which hampered not only every military movement but also every motion\n",
      "beyond cover of the bank. Pakenham sent instantly to the fleet for\n",
      "cannon to drive the ships away. In reality he could not so relieve\n",
      "himself, for the American commodore soon placed one twenty-four-pound\n",
      "gun and two twelve-pounders in battery on the opposite bank of the\n",
      "river, where they answered every purpose of annoyance, while the ships\n",
      "after December 28 took little part in action.[528] Pakenham gained\n",
      "nothing by waiting; but he would not advance without artillery, and\n",
      "the sailors, with much labor, brought up a number of light guns,--nine\n",
      "field-pieces, it was said,[529] two howitzers, and a mortar. Pakenham\n",
      "passed two days, December 25 and 26, organizing his force and preparing\n",
      "the battery. At daylight, December 27, the guns were ready. Five pieces\n",
      "suddenly opened with hot shot and shell on the “Carolina,” and in half\n",
      "an hour obliged the crew to abandon her.[530] The “Louisiana,” by\n",
      "extreme exertion, was hauled beyond range while the British battery was\n",
      "occupied in destroying the “Carolina.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing then prevented Pakenham’s advance, and the next morning,\n",
      "December 28, the whole army moved forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “On we went,” said the Subaltern, “for about three miles,\n",
      "   without any halt or hindrance, either from man or inanimate\n",
      "   nature coming in our way. But all at once a spectacle was\n",
      "   presented to us, such indeed as we ought to have looked for, but\n",
      "   such as manifestly took our leaders by surprise. The enemy’s\n",
      "   army became visible. It was posted about forty yards in rear of\n",
      "   a canal, and covered, though most imperfectly, by an unfinished\n",
      "   breastwork.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The British left, coming under the fire of the “Louisiana,” was\n",
      "immediately halted and placed as far as possible under cover. The\n",
      "skirmishers in the swamp were recalled. In the evening the whole army\n",
      "was ordered to retire beyond cannon-shot and hut themselves.[531] They\n",
      "obeyed; but “there was not a man among us who failed to experience both\n",
      "shame and indignation.”[532]\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond doubt, such caution was not expected from Sir Edward Pakenham.\n",
      "Sir George Prevost at Sackett’s Harbor and Plattsburg, and Colonel\n",
      "Brooke at Baltimore had retired before American works; but those works\n",
      "had been finished forts, strongly held and situated on elevated points.\n",
      "Even with such excuses, and after suffering severe losses, Prevost was\n",
      "discredited for his retreats. Pakenham did not live to make a report,\n",
      "and his reasons remained unavowed; but Admiral Cochrane reported\n",
      "that it was “thought necessary to bring heavy artillery against this\n",
      "work, and also against the ship which had cannonaded the army when\n",
      "advancing.”[533] The decision implied that Pakenham considered the\n",
      "chances unfavorable for storming the American line.\n",
      "\n",
      "In effect, Pakenham’s withdrawal December 28 was equivalent to\n",
      "admitting weakness in his infantry, and to calling on the artillery as\n",
      "his strongest arm. The experiment showed little self-confidence. Not\n",
      "only must he sacrifice two or three days in establishing batteries, but\n",
      "he must challenge a contest with cannon,--weapons which the Americans\n",
      "were famous for using, both afloat and ashore, with especial skill.\n",
      "Jackson could also mount heavy guns and allow Pakenham to batter\n",
      "indefinite lines. Sooner or later Pakenham must storm, unless he could\n",
      "turn the American position.\n",

      "banditti” of Barataria, who to the number of twenty or thirty were\n",
      "received by General Jackson into the service and given the care of two\n",
      "twenty-four-pounders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number and position of the British guns were given in Lieutenant\n",
      "Peddie’s sketch of the field. Before the reconnaissance of December\n",
      "28, field-pieces had been placed in battery on the river-side to\n",
      "destroy the “Carolina” and “Louisiana.” Canon Gleig said that “nine\n",
      "field-pieces, two howitzers, and one mortar” were placed in battery\n",
      "on the river-side during the night of December 25.[536] Captain\n",
      "Henley of the “Carolina” reported that five guns opened upon him on\n",
      "the morning of December 26.[537] Captain Peddie’s sketch marked seven\n",
      "pieces mounted in battery on the river-side, bearing on Commodore\n",
      "Patterson’s battery opposite, besides four pieces in two batteries\n",
      "below. Their range was sufficient to destroy the “Carolina” and pierce\n",
      "the breastwork across the river,[538] and therefore they were probably\n",
      "twelve and nine pounders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides these lighter long-range guns, the British constructed three\n",
      "batteries in the night of December 31.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “Four eighteen-pounders,” reported Major Forrest,[539] British\n",
      "   assistant-quartermaster-general, “were placed in a battery\n",
      "   formed of hogsheads of sugar, on the main road, to fire upon\n",
      "   the ship if she dropped down. Preparations were also made to\n",
      "   establish batteries,--one of six eighteen-pounders, and one\n",
      "   of four twenty-four-pound carronades; also batteries for the\n",
      "   field-pieces and howitzers, the latter to keep the fire of\n",
      "   the enemy under, while the troops were to be moved forward in\n",
      "   readiness to storm the works as soon as a practicable breach was\n",
      "   effected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Peddie’s sketch the Battery No. 6, on the road or new\n",
      "levee, contained not four but two guns. Battery No. 5, some fifty yards\n",
      "from No. 6, contained six guns, as Major Forrest reported. Battery No.\n",
      "4, to the left of the old levee, contained four guns, probably the\n",
      "carronades. Battery No. 3, to the right of the old levee, contained\n",
      "five guns, probably the field-pieces and howitzers. In all, seventeen\n",
      "guns bore on the American lines,--besides seven, in Batteries No. 7 and\n",
      "No. 8, bearing on Commodore Patterson’s three-gun battery across the\n",
      "river. According to Gleig,[540] the British had thirty guns; but in\n",
      "any case they used not less than twenty-four guns, throwing a heavier\n",
      "weight of metal than was thrown by the fifteen pieces used by the\n",
      "Americans. The British artillery was served by regular artillerists.\n",
      "\n",
      "These details were particularly interesting, because the artillery\n",
      "battle of Jan. 1, 1815, offered the best test furnished during the\n",
      "war of relative skill in the use of that arm. The attack had every\n",
      "advantage over the defence. The British could concentrate their fire\n",
      "to effect a breach for their troops to enter; the Americans were\n",
      "obliged to disperse their fire on eight points. The American platforms\n",
      "being elevated, offered a better target than was afforded by the low\n",
      "British batteries, and certainly were no better protected. Three of\n",
      "the American guns were in battery across the river, three quarters of\n",
      "a mile from the main British battery of six eighteen-pounders, while\n",
      "the “Louisiana’s” carronades were beyond range, and the “Louisiana”\n",
      "herself was not brought into action.[541] On the American side the\n",

      "   our disgrace, was slow of making its appearance; a heavy mist\n",
      "   obscured him, and the morning was far advanced before it cleared\n",
      "   away. At last, however, the American lines were visible, and\n",
      "   then began a fire from our batteries, so brisk and so steadily\n",
      "   kept up that we who were behind made not the smallest doubt\n",
      "   of its effect. It was answered for a while faintly, and with\n",
      "   seeming difficulty. By and by, however, the enemy’s salutation\n",
      "   became more spirited, till it gradually surpassed our own, both\n",
      "   in rapidity and precision. We were a good deal alarmed at this,\n",
      "   and the more that a rumor got abroad that our batteries were not\n",
      "   proof against the amazing force of the American shot. We had,\n",
      "   it may be stated, imprudently rolled into the parapets barrels\n",
      "   filled with sugar, under the impression that sugar would prove\n",
      "   as effectual as sand in checking the progress of cannon-balls.\n",
      "   But the event showed that we had been completely mistaken. The\n",
      "   enemy’s shot penetrated these sugar-hogsheads as if they had\n",
      "   been so many empty casks, dismounting our guns and killing our\n",
      "   artillery-men in the very centre of their works. There could be\n",
      "   small doubt, as soon as these facts were established, how the\n",
      "   cannonading would end. Our fire slackened every moment; that\n",
      "   of the Americans became every moment more terrible, till at\n",
      "   length, after not more than two hours and a half of firing, our\n",

      "EFFECTUALLY stopped by these repeated miscarriages, General\n",
      "Pakenham, with fully five thousand good soldiers at his command,\n",
      "decided to wait an entire week for Major-General Lambert, who was then\n",
      "on his way with two fresh regiments. In the meanwhile Pakenham adopted\n",
      "a suggestion made first by Vice-Admiral Cochrane,[548] to prepare for\n",
      "throwing a force across the river to turn Jackson’s line from the\n",
      "opposite bank. The plan required that the Villeré canal should be\n",
      "extended through the levee to the river without the knowledge of the\n",
      "Americans. Perhaps Pakenham would have done better by dragging his\n",
      "boats across the intervening space; but he preferred to dig a canal,\n",
      "and the work, begun January 4, was done so successfully that until\n",
      "January 6, when it was completed, Jackson did not suspect the movement.\n",
      "On the same day Lambert’s division arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this week of inaction the Americans gained little advantage. The\n",
      "lines were strengthened; but although the Kentucky reinforcements, more\n",
      "than two thousand in number, under General Thomas and John Adair,\n",
      "arrived January 4, they were ill provided with arms, and Jackson\n",
      "could furnish them neither with arms, clothing, nor equipment. The\n",
      "Louisiana militia were in the same condition. Jackson did his utmost\n",
      "to supply these wants; the people of New Orleans did more, and lent at\n",
      "last the few hundred muskets reserved against the danger of a slave\n",
      "insurrection,[549] until in the end, if Adair was correct, a thousand\n",
      "of the Kentuckians were placed in the line of battle. Yet after all the\n",
      "reinforcements had been mustered, Jackson’s main dependence was still\n",
      "on his artillery and his intrenchments. In the open field he could not\n",
      "meet the British force.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his immediate front, Jackson had little to fear. Three thousand\n",
      "marksmen, behind intrenchments everywhere at least five feet high,\n",
      "defended by heavy guns and supported by the “Louisiana” on the river\n",
      "and a strong battery on the opposite shore, could defy twice or three\n",
      "times their number advancing across an open plain under fire of eight\n",
      "or ten heavy guns. The result of the artillery battle of January 1,\n",
      "as well as the reconnaissance of December 28, showed what the British\n",
      "general and his staff thought of their chances in a front attack. Twice\n",
      "they had refused to attempt it when Jackson’s lines were unfinished;\n",
      "they were not likely to succeed when the lines were strengthened by\n",
      "another week of labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his direct front, therefore, Jackson had reason to think that the\n",
      "British did not intend serious attack. Their next attempt could hardly\n",
      "fail to be a flanking movement. Jackson had been surprised, December\n",
      "23, by such a movement, and feared nothing so much as to be surprised\n",
      "again. For this reason he still kept a large body of troops, three\n",
      "regiments of Louisiana militia, on the north of the city.[550] “His\n",
      "greatest fear, and hence his strongest defence next to the one occupied\n",
      "by himself, was on the Chef Menteur road, where Governor Claiborne, at\n",
      "the head of the Louisiana militia, was posted.” He kept close watch\n",
      "on the bayous which extended on his immediate flank, and constructed\n",
      "other lines in his rear to which he could retreat in case his left\n",
      "flank should be turned through the swamp. Apparently the idea did not\n",
      "occur to him that the British might more easily turn his right flank by\n",
      "throwing a force across the river; and when he learned, January 7, that\n",
      "the British were engaged in making this movement, the time had already\n",
      "passed when he could prevent it.\n",
      "\n",
      "No means had been provided for transporting troops directly from one\n",
      "bank of the river to the other. If obliged to protect the batteries\n",
      "established by Commodore Patterson on the west bank, Jackson must march\n",
      "troops from his lines back five miles to New Orleans, cross them by the\n",
      "ferry, and march them down the other shore. Such a movement required\n",
      "a whole day, and divided the army in a manner hazarding the safety of\n",
      "both wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practically the west bank was undefended when Jackson, January 7, first\n",
      "heard that the British were about to occupy it. Commodore Patterson had\n",
      "mounted there, as has been told, a number of heavy guns in battery, but\n",
      "these guns were not in position to cover their own bank against attack\n",
      "from below. Major Latour was engaged with negroes in laying out lines\n",
      "of defence, but nothing was completed. In an advanced position, about\n",
      "a mile below the line of Jackson’s works, a bastion had been raised\n",
      "close to the river, and near it a small redan, or salient, had been\n",
      "constructed. This work, which was untenable in case of attack in flank\n",
      "or rear, was occupied by four hundred and fifty Louisiana militia,\n",
      "commanded by General David Morgan. During the afternoon of January 7,\n",
      "after the British plan of attack was suspected, General Morgan caused\n",
      "three guns--one twelve-pounder and two six-pounders--to be mounted on\n",
      "his line. Late the same evening General Jackson ordered four hundred\n",
      "men of the Kentucky division to New Orleans, where they were to obtain\n",
      "muskets, then to cross the river, and march down the opposite shore\n",
      "to reinforce Morgan. The Kentuckians obeyed their orders, but they\n",
      "found only about seventy muskets at New Orleans; and not more than two\n",
      "hundred and fifty armed men, weary with marching and faint from want\n",
      "of food, reached Morgan’s quarters at four o’clock on the morning of\n",
      "January 8.[551] Adair, who should have known the number best, declared\n",
      "that only one hundred and seventy men were then in the ranks.[552] They\n",
      "were sent a mile farther and stationed as an advanced line, with one\n",
      "hundred Louisiana militia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus seven or eight hundred tired, ill-armed, and unprotected militia,\n",
      "divided in two bodies a mile apart, waited on the west bank to be\n",
      "attacked by a British column which was then in the act of crossing\n",
      "the river. Their defeat was almost certain. A thousand British troops\n",
      "could easily drive them away, capture all the batteries on the west\n",
      "bank, destroy the “Louisiana” as they had destroyed the “Carolina,”\n",
      "thus turning all Jackson’s lines, and probably rendering necessary\n",
      "the evacuation of New Orleans. For this work Pakenham detached the\n",
      "Eighty-fifth regiment, about three hundred strong, the Fifth West\n",
      "India, two hundred seamen and two hundred marines,--about twelve\n",
      "hundred men in all,[553]--under command of Colonel Thornton, who had\n",
      "led the light brigade at Bladensburg and across Lake Borgne to the\n",
      "Mississippi. The movement was ordered for the night of January 7, and\n",
      "was to be made in boats already collected in the Villeré canal.\n",
      "\n",
      "With some hesitation[554] Pakenham decided to make a simultaneous\n",
      "attack on Jackson. The arrangements for this assault were simple.\n",
      "The usual store of fascines and ladders was provided. Six of the\n",
      "eighteen-pound guns were once more mounted in battery about eight\n",
      "hundred yards from the American line, to cover the attack. The\n",
      "army, after detaching Thornton’s corps, was organized in three\n",
      "divisions,--one, under Major-General Gibbs, to attack Jackson’s left;\n",
      "another, under Major-General Keane, to attack along the river-side; a\n",
      "third, the reserve, to be commanded by Major-General Lambert.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The principal attack was to be made by Major-General Gibbs,” said the\n",
      "British official report.[555] The force assigned to Gibbs consisted\n",
      "of the Fourth, Twenty-first, and Forty-fourth regiments, with three\n",
      "companies of the Ninety-fifth,--about two thousand two hundred\n",
      "rank-and-file.[556] The force assigned to Keane consisted of “the\n",
      "Ninety-third, two companies of the Ninety-fifth, and two companies of\n",
      "the Fusileers and Forty-third,”[557]--apparently about twelve hundred\n",
      "rank-and-file. “The first brigade, consisting of the Fusileers and\n",
      "Forty-third, formed the reserve” under Major-General Keane, apparently\n",
      "also twelve hundred strong. Adding two hundred artillerists and five\n",
      "hundred black troops of the First West India regiment, employed as\n",
      "skirmishers along the edge of the swamp, the whole body of troops\n",
      "engaged on the east bank in the assault, according to the official\n",
      "report and returns of wounded,[558] numbered about five thousand three\n",
      "hundred rank-and-file, consisting of the Fourth, Seventh (Fusileers),\n",
      "Twenty-first, Forty-third, Forty-fourth, Ninety-third, and Ninety-fifth\n",
      "regiments, of whom twenty-two hundred were to attack on the right,\n",
      "twelve hundred on the left, and twelve hundred were to remain in\n",
      "reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus of the whole British force, some eight thousand rank-and-file,\n",
      "fifty-three hundred were to assault Jackson’s line; twelve hundred were\n",
      "to cross the river and assault Morgan; eight hundred and fifty men were\n",
      "detailed for various duties; and the seamen, except two hundred with\n",
      "Colonel Thornton, must have been in the boats.\n",
      "\n",
      "To meet this assault, Jackson held an overwhelming force, in which his\n",
      "mere numbers were the smallest element. According to a detailed account\n",
      "given by Jackson two years afterward, his left wing, near the swamp,\n",
      "was held by Coffee’s brigade of eight hundred and four men; his centre,\n",
      "by Carroll’s brigade of fourteen hundred and fourteen men; his right,\n",
      "near the river, by thirteen hundred and twenty-seven men, including all\n",
      "the regulars; while Adair’s Kentucky brigade, numbering five hundred\n",
      "and twenty-five men, were in reserve.[559] Adair claimed that the\n",
      "Kentuckians numbered fully one thousand. The dispute mattered little,\n",
      "for barely one third of the entire force, whatever it was, discharged a\n",
      "gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides three thousand or thirty-five hundred men on the parapets\n",
      "and a thousand in reserve, Jackson had twelve pieces of artillery\n",
      "distributed along the line, covering every portion of the plain. The\n",
      "earth-wall behind which his men rested was in every part sufficiently\n",
      "high to require scaling, and the mud was so slippery as to afford\n",
      "little footing.[560] Patterson’s battery on the opposite shore\n",
      "increased in force till it contained three twenty-four-pounders and\n",
      "six twelve-pounders,[561] covered the levee by which the British left\n",
      "must advance. The “Louisiana” took no part in the action, her men being\n",
      "engaged in working the guns on shore; but without the “Louisiana’s”\n",
      "broadside, Jackson had more than twenty cannon in position. Such a\n",
      "force was sufficient to repel ten thousand men if the attack were made\n",
      "in open day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakenham, aware of the probable consequences of attacking by daylight,\n",
      "arranged for moving before dawn; but his plan required a simultaneous\n",
      "advance on both banks of the river, and such a combination was liable\n",
      "to many accidents. According to the journal of Major Forrest, the\n",
      "British Assistant-Quartermaster-General,[562] forty-seven boats were\n",
      "brought up the bayou on the evening of January 7:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “As soon as it was dark, the boats commenced to be crossed\n",
      "   over into the river. A dam erected below the sternmost boat\n",
      "   had raised the water about two feet. Still there was a very\n",
      "   considerable fall from the river; and through which, for an\n",
      "   extent of two hundred and fifty yards, the boats were dragged\n",
      "   with incredible labor by the seamen. It required the whole\n",
      "   night to effect this, and the day had dawned before the first\n",
      "   detachment of Colonel Thornton’s corps (about six hundred men)\n",
      "   had embarked; and they just reached the opposite bank when the\n",
      "   main attack commenced on the enemy’s line.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At six o’clock in broad dawn the columns of Gibbs and Keane moved\n",
      "forward toward Jackson’s works, which were lined with American troops\n",
      "waiting for the expected attack. Gibbs’s column came first under\n",
      "fire, advancing near the swamp in close ranks of about sixty men in\n",
      "front.[563] Three of the American batteries opened upon them. Coming\n",
      "within one hundred and fifty yards of the American line, the British\n",
      "column obliqued to the left to avoid the fire of the battery directly\n",
      "in face. As they came within musketry range the men faltered and\n",
      "halted, beginning a confused musketry fire. A few platoons advanced to\n",
      "the edge of the ditch, and then broke. Their officers tried in vain\n",
      "to rally them for another advance. Major-General Gibbs was mortally\n",
      "wounded, according to the official report, “within twenty yards of the\n",
      "glacis.”[564] Pakenham himself rode forward to rally Gibbs’s column,\n",
      "and was instantly struck by a grape-shot and killed, nearly three\n",
      "hundred yards from the American line.[565] “As I advanced with the\n",
      "reserve,” said Lambert’s report, “at about two hundred and fifty yards\n",
      "from the line, I had the mortification to observe the whole falling\n",
      "back upon me in the greatest confusion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Keane’s column on the left moved along the road and between the river\n",
      "and the levee. Pressing rapidly forward, greatly annoyed by Patterson’s\n",

      "   “the enemy had thrown over in his boats a considerable force\n",

      "   enough to advance against the works of General Morgan; and\n",

      "   ingloriously fled, drawing after them by their example the\n",
      "   remainder of the forces, and thus yielding to the enemy that\n",
      "   most formidable position. The batteries which had rendered\n",
      "   me for many days the most important service, though bravely\n",
      "   defended, were of course now abandoned, not however until the\n",
      "   guns had been spiked. This unfortunate rout had totally changed\n",
      "   the aspect of affairs. The enemy now occupied a position from\n",
      "   which they might annoy us without hazard, and by means of which\n",

      "river,” he reported to Governor Shelby,[569] “were obliged to retire\n",
      "before a superior force. They have been calumniated by those who\n",
      "ought to have fought with them, but did not.” The tone of Jackson’s\n",
      "report, and his language afterward, showed a willingness to load the\n",
      "Kentucky troops on the west bank with the responsibility for a military\n",
      "oversight with which they had nothing to do; but the oversight was not\n",
      "the less serious, whoever was responsible for it. The Kentucky and\n",
      "Louisiana troops did not easily yield. The British returns of killed\n",
      "and wounded showed that Thornton’s column suffered a considerable\n",
      "loss. Thornton himself was wounded; his regiment, the Eighty-fifth,\n",
      "numbering two hundred and ninetyeight rank-and file, reported a loss\n",
      "of forty-three men killed, wounded, and missing, besides their colonel.\n",
      "Of one hundred sailors employed in the attack[570] twenty were killed\n",
      "or wounded, besides Captain Money of the royal navy, “who, I am sorry\n",
      "to say, was severely wounded,” said Thornton. The Americans made as\n",
      "good a resistance as could have been expected, and had they resisted\n",
      "longer they would merely have been captured when the next detachment\n",
      "of Thornton’s column came up. The chief blame for the disaster did not\n",
      "rest on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson was helpless to interpose. As he and his men, lining the river\n",
      "bank, watched the progress of Thornton’s column on the opposite shore,\n",
      "Jackson could do nothing; but he ordered his men “that they should take\n",
      "off their hats, and give our troops on the right bank three cheers.”\n",
      "Adair, who inclined to a severe judgment of Jackson’s generalship, told\n",
      "the story more picturesquely:[571]--\n",
      "\n",
      "   “I was standing by him when he gave his order, and with a smile,\n",
      "   not of approbation, observed I was afraid they could not hear\n",
      "   us. The distance from us to them, on a straight line, was upward\n",
      "   of one mile and a half; there was a thick fog, and I confess I\n",
      "   could not see the troops of either army. All I could discover\n",
      "   was the blaze from the guns; and seeing that continue to\n",
      "   progress up the river was the only knowledge we had that our men\n",
      "   were retreating.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson then ordered General Humbert, a French officer acting as\n",
      "a volunteer, to take four hundred men and cross the river at New\n",
      "Orleans to repulse the enemy, cost what it might;[572] but had the\n",
      "enemy pressed his advantage, no force at Jackson’s command could have\n",
      "stopped their advance, without causing the sacrifice of Jackson’s\n",
      "lines. Fortunately the only remaining British general, Lambert, was not\n",
      "disposed to make another effort. The eight regiments of regular troops\n",
      "which made the bulk of Pakenham’s army had suffered severely in the\n",
      "assault. One of these regiments, the Eighty-fifth, was with Thornton\n",
      "on the west shore. Two, the Seventh and Forty-third, had been in the\n",
      "reserve, and except two companies had never approached the works within\n",
      "musket-shot, yet had lost fifty-two killed, and about one hundred\n",
      "wounded and missing, in an aggregate of less than eighteen hundred.\n",
      "The five remaining regiments--the Fourth, Twenty-first, Forty-fourth,\n",
      "Ninety-third, and Ninety-fifth--were nearly destroyed. They went into\n",
      "battle probably about three thousand strong:[573] they lost seventeen\n",
      "hundred and fifty men killed, wounded, and missing. The total British\n",
      "loss was two thousand and thirty-six.[574] The American loss was\n",
      "seventy-one. Even on the west bank the American loss was much less than\n",
      "that of the British.\n",
      "\n",
      "The loss of three major-generals was almost as serious as the loss of\n",
      "one third of the regular Infantry. Lambert, the fourth major-general,\n",
      "weighed down by responsibility and defeat, had no wish but to escape.\n",
      "He recalled Thornton’s corps the same evening from its position on the\n",
      "opposite bank, and the next day, January 9, began preparations for his\n",
      "difficult and hazardous retreat.[575]\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakenham’s assault on Jackson’s lines at New Orleans, January 8,\n",
      "repeated the assault made by Drummond, August 15, at Fort Erie.\n",
      "According to the British account of that battle, Drummond’s engaged\n",
      "force numbered twenty-one hundred and forty men; the reserve, about one\n",
      "thousand.[576] Drummond’s direct attack, being made by night, was more\n",
      "successful than Pakenham’s; his troops approached nearer and penetrated\n",
      "farther than those of Gibbs and Keane; but the consequences were the\n",
      "same. Of three thousand men, Drummond lost nine hundred and five. Of\n",
      "six thousand, engaged in the double action of Jan. 8, 1815, Pakenham\n",
      "lost two thousand and thirty-six. In each case the officers commanding\n",
      "the assaulting columns were killed or wounded, and the repulse was\n",
      "complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the battle General Lambert’s position was critical. His\n",
      "withdrawal of Thornton’s corps from the west bank betrayed his\n",
      "intention of retiring, and his line of retreat was exposed to attack\n",
      "from the bayou which headed near Jackson’s camp. Fortunately for him,\n",
      "Jackson was contented with checking his advance.\n",

      "determined to attack Mobile. “It was decided,” reported Lambert,[580]\n",
      "“that a force should be sent against Fort Bowyer, situated on the\n",
      "eastern point of the entrance of the bay, and from every information\n",
      "that could be obtained it was considered that a brigade would be\n",

      "\n",
      "Jackson’s determination to defend Mobile had already deprived him of\n",
      "the use of more than half the regular troops assigned to his military\n",
      "district, who remained inactive at Mobile during the months of December\n",
      "and January. They were commanded by General Winchester, whose record\n",
      "as a military officer was not reassuring. Although Fort Bowyer was\n",
      "known to be untenable against attack by land, Jackson not only retained\n",
      "Lieutenant-Colonel Lawrence there, but increased his force until he\n",
      "had three hundred and sixty men in his command,--equal to the average\n",
      "strength of an entire regiment, or half the force of regulars which\n",
      "Jackson commanded at New Orleans. This garrison was only large enough\n",

      "   “After the arrival of the British armament the garrison of Fort\n",
      "   Bowyer was not only continued but increased, though from its\n",

      "   campaign. Nor was this the whole extent of the evil, for by the\n",
      "   disposition made of this gallant corps it was not only subjected\n",

      "regular approaches, and could not be prevented from capturing the place\n",
      "without the necessity of assault. Jackson reported to the Secretary of\n",
      "War[582] that this event was one which he “little expected to happen\n",

      "without even a fire from the enemy’s batteries is as astonishing as it\n",
      "is mortifying.” In truth, the military arrangements, not Lawrence’s\n",
      "defence, were responsible for the result; and Jackson had reason to\n",
      "fear that a greater disaster was at hand, for unless General Winchester\n",
