# Prolog Resolution Algorithm and SAT Solver

This Prolog code implements the Resolution algorithm and the Davis-Putnam SAT solver. 
The Resolution algorithm is applied to various sets of propositional clauses derived from a knowledge base created by me, expressed in natural language, transformed into First Order Logic (FOL), and converted into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
My Davis-Putnam SAT solver employs two strategies for selecting atoms: based on frequency of appearance in the knowledge base or as the most balanced atom.
